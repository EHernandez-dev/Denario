Prior Knowledge and Skills\n\n- **No coding or technical background is required.** The course is designed for cross-functional professionals, including those in operations, finance, research, and creative roles.\n- **Basic digital literacy:** Participants should be comfortable navigating web applications, uploading/downloading files, and using productivity tools (e.g., spreadsheets, word processors).\n- **Familiarity with business workflows:** While not mandatory, experience with business documentation, data analysis, or research tasks will help contextualize exercises.\n\n### 2. Required Accounts and Access\n\n- **ChatGPT Plus or Teams/Enterprise Account:**  \n  - Participants must have an active subscription to ChatGPT Plus or access to a Teams/Enterprise tenant.\n  - The account must support the following features:\n    - Advanced Data Analysis (ADA)\n    - Browse (web browsing)\n    - Vision (image/PDF analysis)\n    - Image Generation\n    - File Uploads (multi-file support)\n    - Custom Instructions/Memory\n    - Custom GPT Builder (for modules on Custom GPTs)\n    - GPT Store access (for simulated publishing)\n    - Teams/Enterprise workspace features (for governance module)\n- **Instructor Demo Tenant:**  \n  - If participants lack access to certain features (e.g., Custom GPT Builder), the instructor should provide a demo environment or facilitate group walkthroughs.\n\n### 3. Technical Setup\n\n- **Hardware:**\n  - Modern computer with a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari)\n  - Minimum 8 GB RAM recommended for smooth file handling and multitasking\n  - Headset or speakers for live sessions and discussions\n\n- **Software:**\n  - Up-to-date web browser\n  - Ability to open and edit CSV, DOCX, and PDF files (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Docs/Sheets, or free alternatives)\n  - Optional: basic image viewer/editor for reviewing generated images\n\n- **Network:**\n  - Reliable internet connection capable of supporting web-based AI tools and file uploads/downloads\n\n### 4. Feature Availability and Fallbacks\n\n- **Feature Verification:**  \n  - Before the course, participants must verify that all required ChatGPT features are enabled in their account/tenant.\n  - A pre-course checklist will be provided to confirm access to ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom Instructions, Custom GPT Builder, and Teams/Enterprise features.\n\n- **Fallback Options:**  \n  - If a feature is unavailable (e.g., Custom GPT Builder, ADA), participants will:\n    - Use simulated workflows (e.g., manual prompt engineering in base ChatGPT for Custom GPTs)\n    - Follow instructor-led demonstrations\n    - Apply alternative tools (e.g., spreadsheet software for data analysis if ADA is not available)\n    - Reference provided decision trees for feature-specific fallbacks\n\n### 5. Data and Privacy Requirements\n\n- **Synthetic Dataset Pack:**  \n  - All exercises use provided synthetic or redacted datasets (CSV, PDF, DOCX, PNG) to avoid handling confidential or personally identifiable information (PII/PHI).\n  - Participants must not upload any real or sensitive business data.\n\n- **Privacy and Compliance:**  \n  - Participants should be aware of their organization\u2019s data privacy policies.\n  - The course enforces a \"no PHI/PII\" policy and includes explicit governance and compliance checkpoints.\n\n### 6. Time Commitment\n\n- **Contact Hours:**  \n  - 24 hours of structured instruction and hands-on labs\n- **Optional Practice:**  \n  - Up to 2 additional hours for self-paced practice or review\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Prerequisites**\n\n| Requirement                | Details/Notes                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ChatGPT Plus/Teams Account | Must include ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Gen, Custom Instructions, Builder     |\n| Hardware                   | Modern computer, 8+ GB RAM, headset                                          |\n| Software                   | Modern browser, office suite, image viewer                                   |\n| Data                       | Use only provided synthetic/redacted files                                   |\n| Feature Verification       | Pre-course checklist; instructor demo tenant as fallback                     |\n| Privacy                    | No confidential/PII data; follow governance best practices                   |\n| Time                       | 24 contact hours + 2 optional practice hours                                 |\n\n---\n\n**Potential Challenges and Mitigations:**\n\n- **Feature Gaps:** Some enterprise tenants may restrict access to certain features (e.g., Custom GPT Builder, ADA).
