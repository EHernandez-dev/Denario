Prior experience in roles involving strategic planning, business analysis, or management will enhance the learning experience.\n\n### Technical Prerequisites\n\n- **No Coding Required:**  \n  The course is explicitly structured for non-coders. No programming, scripting, or advanced technical skills are necessary.\n\n- **Basic Digital Literacy:**  \n  Participants should be comfortable using web browsers, navigating online platforms, and working with common business productivity tools (e.g., spreadsheets, document editors).\n\n- **ChatGPT Account:**  \n  Attendees should have access to an OpenAI ChatGPT account. For full participation in all exercises, access to both the free (GPT-3.5) and premium (GPT-4, Advanced Data Analysis, web browsing, plugins) features is recommended.
