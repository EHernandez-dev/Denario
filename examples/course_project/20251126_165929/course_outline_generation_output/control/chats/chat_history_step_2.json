Basic Computer Literacy\n**Justification:**  \nParticipants must be comfortable using web browsers, navigating web-based applications, and managing files (uploading, downloading, organizing). This foundational skill is essential for interacting with the ChatGPT interface, utilizing features such as file uploads, and participating in hands-on exercises.\n\n### 2. Proficiency in English (Reading and Writing)\n**Justification:**  \nSince ChatGPT\u2019s primary interface and most exercises are conducted in English, participants need to read instructions, craft prompts, and interpret outputs effectively. This ensures meaningful engagement with prompt engineering and output evaluation.\n\n### 3. Familiarity with Common Productivity Tools (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Spreadsheets)\n**Justification:**  \nMany real-world applications and workflow integrations discussed in the course involve drafting documents, analyzing data, or automating tasks using ChatGPT in conjunction with standard productivity tools. Familiarity with these tools allows participants to contextualize and apply ChatGPT outputs effectively.\n\n### 4. Access to an OpenAI ChatGPT Account (with Advanced Features Enabled)\n**Justification:**  \nParticipants must have access to a ChatGPT account that supports advanced features such as Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis), File Uploads, Custom Instructions, and the ability to create Custom GPTs. This is critical for hands-on modules that require direct interaction with these functionalities.\n\n### 5. Willingness to Experiment and Iterate\n**Justification:**  \nThe course emphasizes iterative prompt refinement, feedback loops, and troubleshooting. A mindset open to experimentation and learning from trial and error is necessary for participants to fully benefit from the hands-on, feedback-driven approach.\n\n### 6. (Optional but Beneficial) Basic Understanding of AI Concepts\n**Justification:**  \nWhile not strictly required, a general awareness of what artificial intelligence is, and its common applications, will help participants grasp the context and limitations of generative AI models like ChatGPT. This background supports deeper engagement with ethical considerations and advanced modules.\n\n---\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that participants are prepared to engage with the course content, utilize ChatGPT\u2019s advanced features, and apply their learning to real-world scenarios.",
