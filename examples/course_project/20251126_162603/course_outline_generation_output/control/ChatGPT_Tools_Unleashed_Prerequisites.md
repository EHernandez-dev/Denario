## Prerequisites for "ChatGPT Tools Unleashed: Navigating Advanced Features"

### Knowledge and Experience Requirements

- **Basic Familiarity with ChatGPT:** Participants should have prior experience using ChatGPT at a fundamental level. This includes having interacted with the ChatGPT interface (web or app), understanding how to initiate conversations, and being able to interpret basic outputs.
- **General Digital Literacy:** Comfort with standard digital tools (e.g., web browsers, file uploads/downloads, navigating user interfaces) is essential, as the course involves hands-on exercises with ChatGPT’s web-based features.
- **Professional Workflow Awareness:** Participants should have a clear understanding of their own professional workflows and tasks, enabling them to contextualize and apply ChatGPT’s features to real-world scenarios.

### Emerging Trends and Updates Influencing Prerequisites

- **Awareness of Recent ChatGPT Feature Updates:** Given the rapid evolution of ChatGPT, participants should be aware of recent feature rollouts such as persistent memory, custom instructions, file upload capabilities, and tool integrations (e.g., browsing, code interpreter, data analysis). No in-depth knowledge is required, but a general awareness will facilitate smoother onboarding.
- **Understanding of AI Limitations and Ethics:** As AI adoption grows, there is increasing emphasis on responsible use, privacy, and data security. Participants should be open to discussions around these topics, though no prior expertise is required.

### Required Familiarity with ChatGPT or Related Tools

- **No Coding or Technical Background Required:** The course is explicitly designed for non-technical professionals. However, prior exposure to ChatGPT or similar conversational AI tools (e.g., Google Bard, Microsoft Copilot) is beneficial.
- **Optional: Experience with Productivity Tools:** Familiarity with common productivity platforms (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Workspace) may enhance the ability to integrate ChatGPT into daily tasks, but is not mandatory.

### Necessary Soft Skills

- **Adaptability:** Willingness to experiment with new features and adapt workflows to incorporate AI-driven tools.
- **Problem-Solving Mindset:** Ability to identify challenges in current workflows and explore how ChatGPT’s features can address them.
- **Critical Thinking:** Capacity to evaluate AI-generated outputs, recognize limitations, and iterate on instructions or prompts for improved results.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Openness to sharing insights and learning from peers during group exercises and case studies.
