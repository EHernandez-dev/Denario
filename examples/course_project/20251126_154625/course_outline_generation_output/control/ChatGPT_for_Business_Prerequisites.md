  - Familiarity with standard productivity tools (e.g., email, word processors, spreadsheets) is required.

- **Business Acumen**
  - Participants should have a foundational understanding of business operations, organizational structures, and common business functions (e.g., marketing, sales, customer service, HR).
  - Experience in a professional business environment is expected, as course content is contextualized for real-world business scenarios.

### Optional (Beneficial) Prerequisites

- **Familiarity with AI Concepts**
  - While not required, prior exposure to basic artificial intelligence or machine learning concepts (e.g., what AI is, general capabilities and limitations) will help participants grasp technical discussions more quickly.

- **Experience with ChatGPT or Similar Tools**
  - Previous use of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s platform, or other conversational AI tools is advantageous but not mandatory. Introductory modules will cover all necessary foundational knowledge.

- **Technical Background**
  - No programming or advanced technical skills are required. However, participants with experience in workflow automation, API usage, or data analysis may find it easier to engage with advanced modules (e.g., API integration, plugin use).
