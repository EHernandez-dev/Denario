The audience is expected to have business acumen but limited or no background in AI, programming, or data science. The focus is on practical, actionable skills that can be directly applied to real-world business contexts.\n\n## Essential Competencies and Skills\n\n### 1. Foundational Understanding of AI and ChatGPT\n- **Competency:** Recognize the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT and generative AI.\n- **Skill Example:** Distinguish between tasks ChatGPT can automate (e.g., drafting emails, summarizing reports) and those requiring human intervention.\n- **Business Outcome:** Enables informed decision-making about where and how to deploy AI tools for maximum impact.\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering\n- **Competency:** Formulate effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from ChatGPT.\n- **Skill Example:** Create clear, context-rich instructions for ChatGPT to generate business reports, customer responses, or market analyses.\n- **Business Outcome:** Improves efficiency and quality of AI-generated content, reducing time spent on revisions and clarifications.\n\n### 3. Contextual Analysis and Input Structuring\n- **Competency:** Analyze business scenarios to provide ChatGPT with relevant context and data.\n- **Skill Example:** Structure input data (e.g., customer feedback, sales figures) to guide ChatGPT in producing tailored insights or recommendations.\n- **Business Outcome:** Ensures AI outputs are relevant, accurate, and actionable within specific business contexts.\n\n### 4. Strategic Application to Business Problems\n- **Competency:** Identify and prioritize business use cases where ChatGPT can add value.\n- **Skill Example:** Map business processes (e.g., customer support, internal documentation, brainstorming) to potential ChatGPT applications.\n- **Business Outcome:** Drives targeted adoption of AI, leading to measurable improvements in productivity, customer satisfaction, or innovation.\n\n### 5. Evaluation and Iteration of AI Outputs\n- **Competency:** Critically evaluate ChatGPT responses for accuracy, relevance, and bias.\n- **Skill Example:** Review and refine AI-generated content, using feedback loops to improve prompt design and output quality.\n- **Business Outcome:** Maintains high standards for business communications and decision-making, mitigating risks associated with AI errors.\n\n### 6. Ethical and Responsible Use of AI\n- **Competency:** Recognize ethical considerations and best practices in deploying ChatGPT for business.\n- **Skill Example:** Identify scenarios where AI use may introduce bias, privacy concerns, or compliance risks, and apply mitigation strategies.\n- **Business Outcome:** Supports responsible AI adoption, safeguarding organizational reputation and regulatory compliance.\n\n### 7. Collaboration and Change Management\n- **Competency:** Facilitate team adoption of ChatGPT and foster a culture of AI-driven innovation.\n- **Skill Example:** Lead workshops or discussions to share best practices and success stories within the organization.\n- **Business Outcome:** Accelerates organizational learning and maximizes the return on investment in AI technologies.\n\n## Contribution to Business Outcomes\nThese competencies collectively empower non-technical professionals to:\n- Streamline routine tasks and free up time for higher-value work.\n- Enhance decision-making with AI-augmented insights.\n- Foster innovation by integrating AI into business processes.\n- Ensure ethical, effective, and sustainable use of AI tools in the workplace.\n\nThis foundation will inform the subsequent course structure, ensuring each module builds relevant, actionable skills aligned with business objectives.",
