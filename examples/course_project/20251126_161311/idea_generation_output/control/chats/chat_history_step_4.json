    "content": "Thoughts on Ideas:\n- Idea 1: Mastering ChatGPT: From Prompt Crafting to Advanced Tool Utilization\n    \u2022 This idea benefits from a clear structure by introducing foundational prompt engineering and scaling up to advanced features like plugins and integrations.  \n    \u2022 The inclusion of hands-on workshops with specific examples and case studies is pedagogically strong, ensuring the content remains actionable.  \n    \u2022 However, the plan risks overloading participants within the 24-hour timeframe; additional streamlining or prioritization of the most impactful features could improve overall feasibility.  \n    \u2022 To deepen technical content further, consider incorporating more explicit tool demonstrations and module breakdowns that indicate time limits and step-by-step progress, ensuring non-coders can easily follow along.  \n    \u2022 A focus on balancing general concepts with concise, practical exercises could help maintain engagement without sacrificing depth.\n\n- Idea 2: ChatGPT Proficiency for Non-Coders: From Basics to Breakthroughs\n    \u2022 This concept is well-targeted by centering on non-coders and emphasizes accessible advanced features, which makes it appealing for the target professional audience.  \n    \u2022 The combination of interactive labs, group discussions, and the development of a strategic plan provides a blend of theory and practical application; these elements are likely to enhance the learning experience.  \n    \u2022 While the approach is promising, further enhancements might include more explicit breakdowns of advanced functionalities (such as specific plugins or extensions) to reinforce technical depth without resorting to coding.  \n    \u2022 Ensuring that each session has clear, actionable steps and measurable objectives will help keep the course feasible within the 3-day window.  \n    \u2022 Refining the technical roadmap with example modules or case study walkthroughs can strike a better balance between conceptual understanding and concrete tool usage.",
