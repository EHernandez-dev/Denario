    "content": "**Thoughts on Ideas:**\n\n- Idea 1: ChatGPT Pro Power User \u2014 Revised 24-hour Intensive\n  *What it is (short):* A broad, cross-functional 24-hour intensive that teaches prompting, context engineering, ADA, Browse, Vision, image generation, multi-file workflows, Custom GPTs (builder/Knowledge), and Teams/Enterprise governance. Revisions added deeper Vision and Custom GPT labs, synthetic-data pack, and fallback paths for tenants without features.\n\n  - Mock\u2011teach timeline simulation (issues & rebalancing)\n    - Issues found when mock-teaching:\n      - Scope overload: Modules 4 (ADA), 5 (Vision), and 7 (Custom GPTs) each require deep, hands-on iteration (data wrangling, OCR edge-case handling, builder/test cycles). Running them sequentially as fixed 3-hour blocks leaves insufficient time for troubleshooting, peer review, and instructor remediation.\n      - Thin treatment of Custom GPT actions: Module 7 still simulates no-code Actions rather than letting learners build/test end-to-end. Testing + iteration + publish/permission settings typically need >3 hours for novice builders.\n      - Image generation iteration: Module 6 expects multiple rounds of creative A/B refining plus accessibility checks \u2014 that realistically consumes 2\u20133 rounds of edits, which pushes past the 3-hour cap when combined with Vision extractions and ADA exports.\n      - Browse (Module 3) can be lightweight, but safe-sourcing and cross-verification take time, especially when teaching citation hygiene.\n    - Concrete rebalance (keeps 24 hours):\n      - Reduce Module 1 (LLM fundamentals) to 2:30 (concise exercises + prep).\n      - Reduce Module 3 (Browse) to 2:30.\n      - Increase Module 4 (ADA) to 3:30 and Module 5 (Vision) to 3:30.\n      - Increase Module 7 (Custom GPTs) to 4:00 (hands-on builder + peer bug-bash).\n      - Decrease Module 6 (Image gen) to 2:00 (focus on iteration patterns rather than many refinements).\n      - Net result: 2:30 + 3:00 + 2:30 + 3:30 + 3:30 + 2:00 + 4:00 + 3:00 = 24:00.\n    - Why this rebalance: Allocates extra time to high-variance, troubleshooting-heavy modules (ADA, Vision, Builder), preserves core prompting/context in condensed but focused format, and keeps a capstone governance block intact.\n\n  - Governance / privacy audit (operational settings & compliance)\n    - Teams/Enterprise recommended settings:\n      - Workspace-level data retention = 30 days for uploaded learner artifacts; automatic purge after 30 days unless flagged for retention.\n      - Audit logging enabled for uploads, downloads, sharing, and Custom GPT publishing actions (retain logs 180 days).\n      - Role-based access: Owner (instructor), Editor (learners during session, auto-revoke), Viewer (post-course).\n      - DLP: Block external connectors/integrations for the training workspace; disable data forwarding.\n      - Custom GPT publishing: restrict to \u201cUnlisted\u201d within organization; require owner approval for public listing.\n    - Where anonymization / redaction required:\n      - Any real org documents must be redacted before upload; PHI/PII must not be uploaded in live labs.\n      - Use synthetic/redacted datasets for hands-on work.\n    - Compliance checklist (minimum):\n      1. Do not upload PHI/PII \u2014 use synthetic/redacted datasets only.\n      2. Enable audit logging for the workspace and export logs at end of course.\n      3. Set workspace retention = 30 days; auto-delete learner uploads after retention period.\n      4. Disable Browse/data-export to external connectors for the training workspace (unless explicitly approved).\n      5. Require instructor sign-off for any real-data upload; enforce redaction SOP and manual review.\n    - Flagged risky assumption: Assumes ADA, Vision, and Builder available to all learners. Operational alternative: instructor demo tenant + local simulation labs for learners without features.\n\n  - Measurable outcome metrics (per module; 1\u20134 rubric; pass defined)\n    - Module 1 (Prompts): artifact = prompt_set.xlsx. Metrics: clarity (1\u20134), reproducibility (1\u20134), efficiency (concise tokens) (1\u20134). Pass = avg \u22653.0.\n    - Module 2 (Custom Instructions): before_after_log.csv. Metrics: personalization impact (\u0394 quality score by reviewer 0\u20132), reproducibility (1\u20134), privacy alignment (binary compliance). Pass = personalization \u0394 \u2265+0.5 and privacy = pass.\n    - Module 3 (Browse): 1-page brief. Metrics: citation quality (1\u20134), relevance (1\u20134), recency (1\u20134). Pass = all \u22653.\n    - Module 4 (ADA): KPI CSV + chart + summary. Metrics: correctness (calc math) (1\u20134), chart clarity (1\u20134), narrative alignment to data (1\u20134). Pass = correctness \u22653 and avg \u22653.\n    - Module 5 (Vision): extracted CSV + QA report. Metrics: extraction completeness (%) target \u226595, numeric accuracy (error rate \u22645%), correction log quality (1\u20134). Pass = completeness \u226595% or documented manual corrections <5 rows.\n    - Module 6 (Image gen): 2 images + accessibility checklist. Metrics: brand fit (1\u20134), accessibility compliance (WCAG flags) (binary), iteration trace (has \u22652 versions). Pass = brand fit \u22653 and accessibility = pass.\n    - Module 7 (Custom GPTs): scaffold + test_log.csv. Metrics: grounding fidelity (citation accuracy) (1\u20134), abstention behavior (binary), JSON output validity (parseable). Pass = grounding \u22653 and abstention = pass.\n    - Module 8 (Governance + Capstone): capstone_pack.zip. Metrics: tool integration (\u22653 tools used) (1\u20134), SOP completeness (1\u20134), governance compliance (binary). Pass = avg \u22653 and governance = pass.\n\n  - Top\u20115 prioritized action items (Idea 1)\n    1. Reallocate module durations as proposed (shift 1 hr into ADA/Vision/Builder).\n    2. Build an instructor-managed demo tenant + synthetic dataset pack; provide explicit fallback labs for feature gaps.\n    3. Replace simulated Actions with a constrained, hands\u2011on \u201cJSON output \u2192 downstream mock consumer\u201d lab in Module 7.\n    4. Enforce redaction SOP and implement workspace retention/audit settings before running any live cohort.\n    5. Create pre-course feature availability checklist and learner segmentation (Plus vs Enterprise) to route labs.\n\n  - Changelog.md update (summary)\n    - Add entry: \u201cAfter mock-teach, increased time for ADA, Vision, Custom GPTs; added strict privacy controls (30\u2011day retention, audit logs), required synthetic data for labs, and replaced simulated Actions with a JSON\u2011consumer lab.\u201d\n\n- Idea 3: Document Intelligence & Automation \u2014 Revised 24-hour Intensive\n  *What it is (short):* A document-centric 24-hour course aimed at legal ops, HR, compliance, and PMs focused on Vision-powered extraction, OCR-error handling, ADA normalization, Knowledge-backed Q&A, redaction/anonymization, and governance. Revisions added redaction labs, dirty-doc scenarios, and explicit privacy modules.\n\n  - Mock\u2011teach timeline simulation (issues & rebalancing)\n    - Issues found when mock-teaching:\n      - Module 2 (Vision for Dirty Docs + OCR) is the most time\u2011consuming: deskewing, low-contrast scans, ambiguous cells, and clarifying-question cycles often require instructor intervention and peer review.\n      - Module 3 (Normalization & ADA) depends on high-quality extraction from M2; if M2 runs long, M3 gets squeezed. Expect chaining latencies (upload \u2192 ADA processing \u2192 iteration) that produce wait times.\n      - Module 7 (Governance & Privacy) currently 3:00 is borderline \u2014 the redaction lab + policy mapping + configuring Teams settings needs instructor-led examples and hands-on practice.\n    - Concrete rebalance (keeps 24 hours):\n      - Increase Module 2 to 4:00 to allow multiple dirty-doc cases and manual correction workflows.\n      - Increase Module 7 to 3:30 to deepen redaction + settings practice.\n      - Reduce Module 4 (Policy redlining) to 2:30 (still feasible with focused diffing exercises).\n      - Reduce Module 1 (Prompting for Documents) to 2:30 (condensed templates and quick practice).\n      - Net result: 2:30 + 4:00 + 3:00 + 2:30 + 3:00 + 3:00 + 3:30 + 2:00 = 24:00.\n    - Why this rebalance: Prioritizes time for extraction and privacy where real risk and rework occur; keeps normalization and Knowledge bot work viable.\n\n  - Governance / privacy audit (operational settings & compliance)\n    - Teams/Enterprise recommended settings:\n      - Workspace retention = 14 days for training artifacts by default; allow instructor extension to 90 days with justification.\n      - Strict DLP rules: automated PII/PHI detection on upload \u2014 quarantine files pending manual redaction.\n      - Audit logging: upload/download/share events with exportable logs retained 365 days.\n      - Access scopes: Redaction-only role, QA-only role, and Instructor role; learners get ephemeral Editor rights revoked post-session.\n      - Disable external integrations and Browse for document processing workspace unless explicitly allowed.\n    - Where anonymization / redaction required:\n      - All uploaded real documents must be fully redacted prior to upload. Synthetic or pre-redacted corpora must be used for hands-on labs.\n      - Redaction lab (Module 7) required for each cohort before other document labs.\n    - Compliance checklist (minimum):\n      1. Do not upload PHI/PII \u2014 enforce via DLP quarantine and instructor check.\n      2. Require redaction lab completion before any document extraction exercises.\n      3. Enable audit logs and export logs at course end for compliance trace.\n      4. Use workspace retention = 14 days unless legal hold is requested.\n      5. Disable external connectors and require instructor approval for any Browse use.\n    - Flagged risky assumption: The course assumes learners can practice on real internal docs \u2014 this must be disallowed except under explicit legal governance and instructor supervision.\n\n  - Measurable outcome metrics (per module; 1\u20134 rubric; pass defined)\n    - Module 1 (Prompting for Documents): structured_summary.json. Metrics: completeness (fields captured %) target \u226595, fidelity (exact quotes present where required) (1\u20134), template adherence (1\u20134). Pass = completeness \u226595% OR fidelity \u22653.\n    - Module 2 (Vision OCR): line_items.csv + error_log. Metrics: extraction completeness (%) target \u226595, per-row confidence (mean \u22650.8), manual corrections documented (\u22645 rows). Pass = completeness \u226595% or documented correction plan for remaining errors.\n    - Module 3 (Normalization with ADA): normalized.csv + change_log.csv. Metrics: normalization correctness (1\u20134), anomalies flagged (%) (should match instructor ground truth), reproducibility (steps recorded) (1\u20134). Pass = correctness \u22653 and reproducibility \u22653.\n    - Module 4 (Policy Comparison): change_matrix.csv. Metrics: change detection accuracy (true positives/false negatives rate), risk scoring alignment with instructor (\u00b11 scale), citation of exact pages (binary). Pass = detection \u226590% TP rate.\n    - Module 5 (Knowledge-backed Q&A): test_log.csv. Metrics: grounding fidelity (% answers citing files) target \u226595, abstention correctness (says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d appropriately) (binary), answer usefulness (1\u20134). Pass = grounding \u226595% and abstention correct.\n    - Module 6 (SOP generation): sop.docx + checklist. Metrics: SLA completeness (presence of SLAs/owners) (binary), exception handling present (binary), reviewer usability score (1\u20134). Pass = all binaries true and reviewer score \u22653.\n    - Module 7 (Governance & Redaction): privacy_checklist.md + access_matrix.csv. Metrics: redaction accuracy (no sample PII left) (binary), DLP rules configured (binary), audit log completeness (binary). Pass = all binaries true.\n    - Module 8 (Capstone): decision_memo.docx + appendix. Metrics: pipeline completeness (all artifacts present) (1\u20134), compliance adherence (binary), evidence-grounding score (1\u20134). Pass = compliance = pass and avg \u22653.\n\n  - Top\u20115 prioritized action items (Idea 3)\n    1. Expand Module 2 to 4 hours and create 3 dirty-doc cases (skewed, low-contrast, multi-table) with instructor solutions.\n    2. Make Module 7 (redaction & governance) mandatory earlier (first session redaction lab gating access to other labs).\n    3. Implement DLP/quarantine workflow for uploads and provide instructor script for manual redaction review.\n    4. Provide a synthetic document pack and automated PII-injector to create test cases for redaction and QA.\n    5. Create a \u201cfailure-mode\u201d cheat-sheet showing when to stop an automated extraction and escalate (legal/engineering).\n\n  - Changelog.md update (summary)\n    - Add entry: \u201cMock-teach showed extraction and privacy require more time. Increased Vision to 4:00, forced pre-flight redaction lab, DLP/quarantine rules, synthetic doc pack, and stronger rubrics for extraction/normalization.\u201d\n\n- Which idea is stronger (short justification)\n  - Verdict: Idea 3 (Document Intelligence & Automation) is stronger for immediate adoption in a 24-hour format. Rationale: it has a narrower, high\u2011value focus (document extraction and governance) that maps cleanly to hands\u2011on labs and compliance-driven constraints; after the rebalance it dedicates the necessary time to the most failure-prone work (Vision/OCR and privacy). Idea 1 is ambitious and valuable but remains riskier to deliver in 24 hours due to breadth and tenant-feature variability; it requires more fallbacks or splitting into two 24-hour tracks to be reliably teachable.\n\nIf you want, I will:\n- produce updated syllabus.csv entries reflecting the new module durations and artifacts, and\n- generate the specific redaction SOP and DLP checklist to embed in instructor materials.",
