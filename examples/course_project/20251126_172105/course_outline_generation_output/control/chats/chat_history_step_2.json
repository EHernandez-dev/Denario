The prerequisites are designed to be accessible to a broad range of professionals, with no expectation of coding or technical AI expertise.\n\n### Required Knowledge and Experience\n\n- **Familiarity with Digital Communication Platforms**\n  - Participants should have experience using common workplace communication tools such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Google Meet.\n  - Example: Regularly sending messages, sharing files, or participating in group chats or video calls.\n\n- **Basic Use of Productivity Tools**\n  - Comfort with standard productivity software, including word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs), spreadsheets (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets), and cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).\n  - Example: Creating, editing, and sharing documents or spreadsheets as part of daily work tasks.\n\n- **Experience with Web-Based Applications**\n  - Ability to navigate web browsers, manage tabs, and interact with web-based platforms.\n  - Example: Using online project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana) or customer relationship management (CRM) systems.\n\n- **Basic Experience with Chatbots or Virtual Assistants (Preferred, Not Required)**\n  - Prior interaction with chatbots (e.g., website support bots, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa) is helpful but not mandatory.\n  - Example: Using a chatbot to get information or complete a simple task online.\n\n- **General Professional Communication Skills**\n  - Ability to articulate questions, provide feedback, and engage in collaborative problem-solving in a professional context.\n\n### No Technical or Coding Background Required\n\n- The course is explicitly designed for non-technical professionals. No prior experience with programming, scripting, or AI model configuration is necessary.\n\n### Summary Table: Prerequisite Examples\n\n| Area                        | Example(s)                                                      |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Digital Communication       | Using Slack or Teams for daily messaging and file sharing        |\n| Productivity Tools          | Editing documents in Google Docs; managing spreadsheets in Excel |\n| Web-Based Applications      | Navigating Trello boards; using online forms                    |\n| Chatbot/Assistant Use       | Asking questions to a website support bot                       |\n| Communication Skills        | Writing clear emails; participating in team discussions         |\n\n---\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that all participants can focus on mastering ChatGPT tools and features without being hindered by basic digital skills gaps.
