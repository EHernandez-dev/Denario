No coding or advanced technical background is required. Across six scaffolded modules, participants will learn foundational concepts, master practical prompt engineering skills, and apply frameworks like RTF and Chain-of-Thought to real-world business scenarios, all while integrating responsible AI practices.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to AI Prompting in Business\n\n### Description:\nThis opening module introduces the fundamentals of AI prompting, emphasizing its growing role in business environments. Participants will explore how AI language models interpret prompts and the impact of prompt quality on business outcomes. The session sets the stage for understanding why prompt engineering is a critical skill for modern professionals.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Clear understanding of what prompts are and how they drive AI outputs.\n- Awareness of the business value and limitations of AI-driven solutions.\n- Foundation for deeper exploration of prompt frameworks.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants identify the core components of an AI prompt.\n- Participants describe the influence of prompt clarity on AI-generated results.\n- Participants recognize common business use cases for AI prompting.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 10 minutes, Debrief: 5 minutes  \nSimple group activity: Participants brainstorm and share examples of business tasks that could benefit from AI prompting.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Foundations of Prompt Frameworks: RTF and Chain-of-Thought\n\n### Description:\nThis module introduces the structure and logic behind key prompt frameworks, focusing on RTF (Role, Task, Format) and Chain-of-Thought. Participants will learn how these frameworks guide AI to produce more relevant and actionable outputs, with examples tailored to business contexts.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Understanding of the structure and purpose of RTF and Chain-of-Thought frameworks.\n- Ability to distinguish between simple and structured prompts.\n- Insight into when and why to use each framework.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants distinguish between basic and framework-based prompts.\n- Participants explain the components and logic of RTF and Chain-of-Thought.\n- Participants identify scenarios where each framework is most effective.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 15 minutes, Debrief: 5 minutes  \nSmall group exercise: Deconstruct sample prompts to identify framework elements and discuss their impact.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Crafting Effective Prompts: Principles and Best Practices\n\n### Description:\nBuilding on foundational knowledge, this module focuses on the practical skills of crafting clear, precise, and contextually relevant prompts. Participants will explore best practices, common pitfalls, and iterative refinement techniques to optimize prompt effectiveness for business tasks.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Practical strategies for writing high-quality prompts.\n- Awareness of common errors and how to avoid them.\n- Tools for refining prompts based on AI output.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants apply best practices to create clear, actionable prompts.\n- Participants evaluate and refine prompts for improved AI responses.\n- Participants recognize and correct common prompt design mistakes.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 20 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes  \nHands-on activity: Participants rewrite poorly performing prompts and compare AI outputs before and after refinement.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Applying Prompt Frameworks to Business Scenarios\n\n### Description:\nThis module provides immersive, scenario-based exercises where participants apply RTF and Chain-of-Thought frameworks to real-world business challenges, such as report generation, customer communication, and data analysis. Emphasis is placed on aligning prompts with specific business objectives.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Direct experience applying frameworks to practical business tasks.\n- Enhanced ability to tailor prompts for diverse business needs.\n- Confidence in using prompt frameworks to drive productivity.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants formulate prompts using RTF and Chain-of-Thought for specific business scenarios.\n- Participants demonstrate the ability to adapt frameworks to new challenges.\n- Participants evaluate the effectiveness of their prompts in achieving business goals.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 30 minutes, Debrief: 15 minutes  \nCase-based group exercise: Teams select a business scenario, craft prompts using both frameworks, and assess AI outputs for relevance and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Responsible AI Use: Risks, Ethics, and Output Validation\n\n### Description:\nThis module addresses the ethical and practical considerations of AI use in business, including potential risks such as unintended or biased outputs. Participants will learn strategies for responsible prompting, output verification, and risk mitigation to ensure safe and effective AI integration.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Awareness of ethical and compliance issues in AI prompting.\n- Strategies for identifying and mitigating risks in AI outputs.\n- Techniques for validating and verifying AI-generated content.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants identify potential risks and ethical concerns in AI prompting.\n- Participants explain methods for verifying and validating AI outputs.\n- Participants apply responsible AI practices to business prompt scenarios.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 15 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes  \nScenario analysis: Participants review AI outputs for a business case, identify risks or errors, and propose mitigation strategies.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Collaborative Prompt Engineering and Continuous Improvement\n\n### Description:\nThe final module emphasizes the importance of collaboration and ongoing refinement in prompt engineering. Participants will practice communicating prompt strategies, co-creating prompts with peers, and establishing feedback loops for continuous improvement in business settings.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Skills for effective communication and collaboration in prompt design.\n- Techniques for iterative improvement of prompts based on team feedback.\n- Framework for integrating prompt engineering into ongoing business processes.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants demonstrate collaborative prompt creation and refinement.\n- Participants articulate prompt strategies to colleagues and stakeholders.\n- Participants formulate a plan for ongoing prompt optimization in their workplace.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 20 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes  \nGroup workshop: Teams co-create prompts for a shared business objective, present their approach, and receive peer feedback for further refinement.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Course Objectives and Expected Outcomes\n\n**Course Objectives:**\n- Equip business professionals with foundational and advanced skills in prompt engineering.\n- Enable participants to apply RTF and Chain-of-Thought frameworks to real-world business scenarios.\n- Foster responsible and ethical AI use, including risk management and output validation.\n- Develop collaborative and communicative competencies for ongoing prompt optimization.\n\n**Expected Participant Outcomes:**\n- Confidently craft, apply, and refine prompts for diverse business tasks.\n- Select and adapt prompt frameworks to maximize AI productivity and relevance.\n- Recognize and mitigate risks associated with AI-generated outputs.\n- Collaborate effectively to drive continuous improvement in AI interactions within their organizations.",
