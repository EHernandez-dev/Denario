This idea aligns well with the course objectives by focusing on practical applications of ChatGPT in business communication, which is a key interest for the target audience. It effectively combines technical foundations with interactive elements, making it engaging and relevant for business professionals. While it needs clearer time management strategies, its emphasis on real-world scenarios and role-playing exercises offers immediate applicability, which is crucial for professionals seeking to enhance their proficiency without delving into coding.",
