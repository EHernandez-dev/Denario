This step-by-step progression is appealing for non-coders seeking methodical guidance.  \n\u2003- The idea emphasizes practical scenarios and case studies, which is a plus; nevertheless, it could be improved by pinpointing which specific ChatGPT tools (for instance, conversation management modules, prompt engineering methods, or context layering utilities) will be explored, along with clear demonstrations of how these tools interact.  \n\u2003- Further technical depth can be achieved by detailing the actionable strategies to integrate these tools into specific professional contexts\u2014providing more context on tool selection criteria or detailed walkthroughs for best practices can enhance the course's depth.  \n\u2003- The overall feasibility is strong, but there is room for including further explicit instructions on how each tool will be applied in practice. This could involve simulation tasks or layered exercises that clearly define the transition from foundational skills to more nuanced, medium-level features.\n\nOverall, both ideas are promising and well-targeted but would benefit from additional specification on tool implementation and deeper actionable frameworks tailored to practical professional environments.",
