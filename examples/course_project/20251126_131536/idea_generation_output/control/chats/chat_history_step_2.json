    "content": "Thoughts on Ideas:\n\n\u2022 Idea 1: Mastering Prompt Frameworks for Business Efficiency  \n   - This idea clearly targets the precise use of prompt frameworks like RTF and Chain-of-Thought, which is highly relevant for business professionals.  \n   - It has strong educational value by emphasizing practical exercises and real-world applications, but the session must be designed carefully to fit within a short time span.  \n   - Feasibility could be an issue if too many examples are introduced without prioritization; consider focusing on a couple of vital exercises that can be deeply explored within the given timeframe.  \n   - To align with the audience\u2019s non-coding background, ensure that the instructional material minimizes technical jargon and is supported by clear, accessible guides.\n\n\u2022 Idea 2: Strategic Model Selection: Reasoning vs Standard  \n   - This concept addresses an important decision-making aspect: choosing the right model, which is a critical skill for advanced users.  \n   - Educationally, the balance between theory (understanding model distinctions) and practice (case studies and interactive sessions) is promising, but the depth might be hard to achieve within an 8-hour window.  \n   - The model selection process needs to be streamlined to ensure that essential nuances are captured without overwhelming the audience.  \n   - The interactive sessions should be precisely planned to avoid time overrun, possibly by using pre-prepared scenarios that allow quick decision-making practice.\n\n\u2022 Idea 3: Personalizing AI: CustomGPTs, Memory, and Projects  \n   - While personalization is a cutting-edge topic that will attract business professionals seeking tailored AI applications, covering CustomGPT creation, memory usage, and project integration might be overly ambitious for a 2-day course.  \n   - Educational clarity may suffer if too many sub-topics are combined; breaking these into clear segments with a focused goal for each practice session is essential.  \n   - Feasibility might be challenging given the highly practical nature of implementing personalization, which could require longer hands-on sessions than available.  \n   - Consider narrowing the scope to one or two key personalization areas that most directly contribute to business efficiency and user experience.\n\n\u2022 Idea 4: Responsible AI Practices: Handling Hallucinations and Data Privacy  \n   - This idea is critically important, particularly as businesses need to manage risk and compliance with AI implementations.  \n   - The educational value is high, emphasizing ethical practices and real-world implications, but its standalone session may come off as too theoretical if not paired with practical application examples.  \n   - Feasibility is reasonable if a few key case studies and interactive discussions are used, yet there is a risk that the topic may feel disconnected from the \u201cpower user\u201d focus if handled too superficially.  \n   - Tailor the content to include applied exercises on how to detect and remedy hallucinations and data vulnerabilities in real business scenarios to keep the training engaging.\n\n\u2022 Idea 5: Next-Level AI Concepts: RAG and AI Agents  \n   - This idea is innovative and attractive, given its introduction to advanced technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and AI Agents which are highly relevant to forward-thinking businesses.  \n   - However, the content might be too advanced and extensive for an 8-hour course, risking superficial coverage of some topics in an effort to address both.  \n   - Educational clarity needs to be maintained through simplifying concepts and focusing on key applications rather than a deep technical dive.  \n   - The session design should ensure that participants gain actionable insights through interactive experimentation, but this may require carefully curated examples and possibly trimming the scope to avoid overwhelming the audience.",
