General Digital Literacy\nParticipants should possess basic digital literacy, including:\n- Proficiency in using web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for navigating websites and managing tabs.\n- Familiarity with common productivity tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, or similar platforms).\n- Comfort with basic file management (uploading, downloading, organizing files).\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThese skills ensure participants can efficiently access the ChatGPT interface, manage digital resources, and participate in hands-on exercises without technical barriers.\n\n### 2. Experience with Professional Workflows\nParticipants are expected to have:\n- Experience in a professional or organizational setting, such as business, education, administration, marketing, HR, or project management.\n- Familiarity with typical workplace tasks (e.g., drafting emails, preparing reports, conducting research, collaborating on documents).\n\n**Rationale:**  \nUnderstanding professional workflows allows participants to contextualize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities and apply them to real-world scenarios relevant to their roles.\n\n### 3. Basic Understanding of Online Communication Tools\nParticipants should be comfortable with:\n- Using online communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom) for collaboration and group discussions.\n- Engaging in digital group activities, such as brainstorming or document co-authoring.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThis background supports effective participation in collaborative exercises and group labs involving ChatGPT.\n\n### 4. No Coding or Technical AI Background Required\n- No prior experience with programming, scripting, or technical AI concepts is necessary.\n- However, curiosity about AI and willingness to engage with new digital tools is beneficial.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe course is explicitly designed for non-coders, focusing on intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and practical applications rather than technical implementation.\n\n### 5. Optional: Introductory Awareness of AI Concepts\nWhile not required, participants may benefit from:\n- Basic awareness of what artificial intelligence is (e.g., having read articles or attended talks about AI in society or business).\n- Familiarity with common AI terminology (e.g., \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cautomation,\u201d \u201clanguage model\u201d) can enrich understanding but is not mandatory.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThis optional background can help participants more quickly grasp foundational concepts, but all necessary AI terminology and concepts will be introduced and explained in the course.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Prerequisite Knowledge and Rationale**\n\n| Prerequisite Area                | Description/Examples                                  | Rationale for Inclusion                |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Digital Literacy                 | Web browsing, file management, productivity tools     | Enables smooth participation           |\n| Professional Workflow Experience | Drafting emails, reports, collaboration               | Contextualizes ChatGPT applications    |\n| Online Communication Tools       | Slack, Teams, Zoom, Google Docs                      | Supports group exercises               |\n| Coding/AI Technical Background   | Not required                                         | Lowers barrier to entry                |\n| AI Awareness (Optional)          | General AI concepts, terminology                     | Enriches conceptual understanding      |\n\n---\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that all participants, regardless of technical background, can fully engage with the course content and maximize the practical value of ChatGPT in their professional environments.",
