## Prerequisites for "ChatGPT Proficiency for Non-Coders: From Basics to Breakthroughs"

### 1. General Digital Literacy
Participants should possess basic digital literacy, including:
- Proficiency in using web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for navigating websites and managing tabs.
- Familiarity with common productivity tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, or similar platforms).
- Comfort with basic file management (uploading, downloading, organizing files).

**Rationale:**  
These skills ensure participants can efficiently access the ChatGPT interface, manage digital resources, and participate in hands-on exercises without technical barriers.

### 2. Experience with Professional Workflows
Participants are expected to have:
- Experience in a professional or organizational setting, such as business, education, administration, marketing, HR, or project management.
- Familiarity with typical workplace tasks (e.g., drafting emails, preparing reports, conducting research, collaborating on documents).

**Rationale:**  
Understanding professional workflows allows participants to contextualize ChatGPT’s capabilities and apply them to real-world scenarios relevant to their roles.

### 3. Basic Understanding of Online Communication Tools
Participants should be comfortable with:
- Using online communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom) for collaboration and group discussions.
- Engaging in digital group activities, such as brainstorming or document co-authoring.

**Rationale:**  
This background supports effective participation in collaborative exercises and group labs involving ChatGPT.

### 4. No Coding or Technical AI Background Required
- No prior experience with programming, scripting, or technical AI concepts is necessary.
- However, curiosity about AI and willingness to engage with new digital tools is beneficial.

**Rationale:**  
The course is explicitly designed for non-coders, focusing on intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and practical applications rather than technical implementation.

### 5. Optional: Introductory Awareness of AI Concepts
While not required, participants may benefit from:
- Basic awareness of what artificial intelligence is (e.g., having read articles or attended talks about AI in society or business).
- Familiarity with common AI terminology (e.g., “machine learning,” “automation,” “language model”) can enrich understanding but is not mandatory.

**Rationale:**  
This optional background can help participants more quickly grasp foundational concepts, but all necessary AI terminology and concepts will be introduced and explained in the course.
