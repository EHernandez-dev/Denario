include tests, docs, typing, and CI.\n\t\t- Strengths: End-to-end workflow mirroring real engineering; strong process (Spec-Plan-Implement-Test).\n\t\t- Critique highlights: Too ambitious for 1 day; high setup friction (Copilot, CI, permissions); cognitive load from juggling multiple deliverables; needs prebuilt templates and tighter scope.\n\n- Idea 2:\n\t* Idea 2: AI-Accelerated Data Analysis and Simulation (Jupyter + Copilot/Tabnine + ChatGPT)\n\t\t- What it is: Use AI to speed up notebooks, vectorize hotspots, fix bottlenecks, and generate reports; optional notebook-to-package conversion.\n\t\t- Strengths: Highly relevant to STEM analysts; practical optimization and profiling focus.\n\t\t- Critique highlights: Over-broad topic list; risky speedup promises; toolchain confusion (multiple assistants); should focus on profiling + AI-suggested refactors with curated examples and a single primary assistant.\n\n- Idea 3:\n\t* Idea 3: AI-Assisted Refactoring and Porting of Legacy STEM Code\n\t\t- What it is: Explain legacy code with AI, generate golden-master tests, refactor safely, optionally port a small component with parity checks.\n\t\t- Strengths: Addresses a ubiquitous pain point; solid guardrails (golden-master, interface-first prompts).\n\t\t- Critique highlights: Full porting unrealistic in 1 day; licensing/validation pitfalls; should center on a small self-contained function with curated snippets and emphasize AI for explanation/test generation.\n\n- Idea 4:\n\t* Idea 4: Ship a Scientific API in a Day with AI (FastAPI + Copilot + ChatGPT)\n\t\t- What it is: Wrap a scientific model as a REST API with validation, tests, and container packaging; AI scaffolds endpoints, tests, and docs.\n\t\t- Strengths: Concrete deliverable (containerized API); clear contract-first approach; strong relevance for model serving.\n\t\t- Critique highlights: Requires prework (Docker, web basics); CI and load testing likely excessive; potential infra blockers; narrow to 1 endpoint and provide templates/fallbacks.\n\n- Idea 5:\n\t* Idea 5: AI-Driven Test-First Development (Property-Based + Mocks)\n\t\t- What it is: Practice AI-accelerated TDD with property-based tests, then implement robust algorithms; measure coverage/mutation.\n\t\t- Strengths: Teaches powerful testing techniques for numerical/stochastic code; disciplined pipeline.\n\t\t- Critique highlights: Heavy for 1 day; mutation testing may overwhelm; needs 1\u20132 focused katas, simplified toolchain, and property template library.\n\n- Idea 6:\n\t* Idea 6: Improved Idea \u2014 AI-Assisted Scientific Microservice in a Day (FastAPI + Copilot Chat + ChatGPT)\n\t\t- Improvements made: Narrowed to a single endpoint (+/health), contract-first prompting, negative tests, and optional read-only CI demo; preconfigured starter repo with Poetry/Makefile; single primary AI (Copilot Chat) plus ChatGPT for contract drafting.\n\t\t- Sample scenario: POST /simulate/sir with strict Pydantic validation; tests (pytest+HTTPX); Dockerfile provided; smoke tests via curl.\n\t\t- Feasibility tweaks from critique: Time-boxed labs; removed heavy CI; added AI-unavailable fallbacks; acceptance checks simplified to practical goals.\n\t\t- Remaining risks and mitigations: AI access variability (provide offline scaffolds); infra blockers (prework checklist); cognitive load (minute-by-minute schedule).\n\n- Idea 7:\n\t* Idea 7: Improved Idea \u2014 AI-Assisted Legacy Code Deep-Dive: Explain \u2192 Test \u2192 Refactor (Optional Port)\n\t\t- Improvements made: Curated 150-line legacy snippet; golden-master fixtures; prompt templates (hallucination guardrails: \u201ccite the line before changing logic\u201d); realistic tolerances (e.g., atol=1e-9); preconfigured environment (devcontainer/requirements).\n\t\t- Labs: AI-generated summaries/docstrings; characterization tests with seeded RNG; safe refactors under test; optional minimal port with parity checks and PSD invariants.\n\t\t- Feasibility tweaks from critique: Porting optional; numeric tolerances realistic; instructor check-ins; dedicated segment on mitigating AI hallucinations.\n\t\t- Measurable outcomes: 75\u201385% line coverage; all golden-master tests pass; mypy/ruff clean; 20\u201340% cyclomatic complexity reduction; parity within atol=1e-9.\n\n- Idea 8:\n\t* Idea 8: Final Selection Rationale \u2014 Why the Legacy Deep-Dive Won\n\t\t- Best alignment: Directly targets common STEM pain (understanding/refactoring legacy code) without web/Docker overhead; strongest fit for mixed-skill participants.\n\t\t- Lower friction: Fewer infrastructure dependencies and fewer corporate IT blockers than API/Docker; primarily code\u2013test\u2013prompt workflows inside VS Code.\n\t\t- Strong guardrails: Golden-master tests, typed refactors, and explicit hallucination guardrails keep AI assistance safe and verifiable.\n\t\t- Quantifiable benefits: Participants deliver docstrings for 100% functions, 75\u201385% coverage, 20\u201340% complexity reduction, parity within atol=1e-9, and 40\u201360% faster time-to-understand (via a short comprehension quiz); AI assist acceptance rate \u226550%.\n\t\t- Day-one success likelihood: Curated snippets, prebuilt fixtures, and optional porting ensure most participants finish with a high-quality, tested module.\n\n- Idea 9:\n\t* Idea 9: Reflections and Themes Influencing the Final Choice\n\t\t- Scope discipline wins: Narrow, end-to-end deliverables (single endpoint, single legacy snippet) proved most feasible for a 1-day arc.\n\t\t- Toolchain simplicity: Choosing one primary assistant (Copilot Chat) and preconfigured environments reduces cognitive and setup load.\n\t\t- Guardrails are essential: Contract-first specs, golden-master tests, and hallucination guardrails consistently improved safety and outcomes.\n\t\t- Measurable outcomes matter: Coverage, complexity reduction, performance/parity tolerances, and comprehension metrics made impact tangible and guided selection.\n\t\t- STEM specificity: Numerical correctness, validation, and reproducibility needs shaped the emphasis on tests, tolerances, and invariants over broader devops topics.\n\n        ",
