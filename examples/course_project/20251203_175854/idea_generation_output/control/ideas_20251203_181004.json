[{"Idea 1": "Prompt-to-Production: The Professional\u2019s No\u2011Code Power\u2011User Track (Original)", "What it was": "A practical path from clean prompt basics to medium-level mastery\u2014emphasizing structured outputs, context optimization, self-review, and pragmatic evaluation.", "Technical depth and features": "RTCE prompt framework; context packaging (delimiters, variables, rolling summaries); schema-guarded outputs (JSON/tables); iterative prompting and self\u2011critique; response benchmarking/A-B via Compare; Custom Instructions, Memory, Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), Browsing, file uploads, shared links.", "Critique summary": "High relevance and strong deliverables; risk of trying too much in 24 hours (benchmarking, governance), dependence on advanced features, and need for clearer pedagogy and compliance guidance.", "Tools integration": "Balanced core ChatGPT features (Custom Instructions, Memory, file uploads) with medium-level practices (schema-guarding, evaluation sets) to produce repeatable, auditable outputs."}, {"Idea 2": "Build Your Departmental Co\u2011Pilot: Custom GPTs, Knowledge, and Actions (Original)", "What it was": "A no\u2011code track to design specialized assistants using Custom GPTs with Knowledge packs and Actions for team workflows (e.g., legal review, sales briefs).", "Technical depth and features": "GPT Builder; Knowledge uploads; conversation starters; output presets; schema\u2011guided outputs; Access controls; versioning; Actions via OpenAPI specs; governance checklists and evaluation sets.", "Critique summary": "High organizational value but heavy IT/permissions dependencies; scope too large for individuals in 24 hours; best for managers with support.", "Tools integration": "Deep use of Custom GPT ecosystem and schema outputs; practical governance framing but feasibility limited by infrastructure and approvals for a short workshop."}, {"Idea 3": "Data\u2011to\u2011Decision: Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting with Advanced Data Analysis (Original)", "What it was": "Turn spreadsheets/CSVs/PDFs into insights and executive narratives using ADA, with validation and reproducible playbooks.", "Technical depth and features": "ADA for cleaning, joins, pivots, visualization, light modeling; structured outputs to CSV/JSON; chart spec prompting; batch runs; shared links; Browsing for definitions/citations.", "Critique summary": "Strong practical payoff; time pressure on full analysis stack; over-reliance on ADA; risk of statistical misinterpretation without guidance.", "Tools integration": "Showcased ADA as the primary engine with scaffolded prompts and validation steps; reproducibility via templated threads and exports."}, {"Idea 4": "Multimodal Mastery: Vision, Voice, and Document Automation for Professionals (Original)", "What it was": "Apply Vision, voice, and document handling to audits, reviews, and content creation (e.g., table extraction, redlining, mockups).", "Technical depth and features": "Vision for image/diagram/table understanding; PDF/doc uploads; voice mode; image generation; layout-aware extraction prompts; style-transfer with few-shot examples; structured outputs.", "Critique summary": "High-value differentiators but risk of shallow coverage across too many modalities; device and platform variability complicate labs.", "Tools integration": "Emphasized multimodal workflows and structured outputs; needed tighter scoping and standardized assets to fit 24 hours."}, {"Idea 5": "Reliable AI at Work: Verification, Safety, and Compliance Playbook (Original)", "What it was": "Methods to ensure outputs are trustable, traceable, and compliant through verification chains, self-critique, and evaluation.", "Technical depth and features": "Browsing for citations; ADA for batch evaluation and rubric scoring; Memory/Custom Instructions for guardrails; shared links for audits; evaluation sets; schema\u2011locked outputs; human escalation triggers.", "Critique summary": "Essential topic but risks generic guidance across domains; complex org rollouts exceed 24 hours; best as a playbook + starter artifacts.", "Tools integration": "Strong on verification and auditability using schema outputs and evaluation sets; needed domain-specific tailoring and IT/legal pathways."}, {"Idea 6": "Prompt-to-Production (Improved)", "Improvements applied": "Tightened scope to high-frequency tasks (emails/briefs/reports); provided prebuilt schemas/rubrics; timeboxed labs; hybrid evaluation (ADA + human rubric); compliance mini\u2011module; feature fallbacks for no ADA/Browsing environments.", "Step-by-step exemplar": "Policy brief generator with Custom Instructions, RTCE framing, context packaging and rolling summaries, schema-guarded outputs with self-repair, Browsing-backed verification, Compare for A/B, ADA mini eval set, and shared-link handoff.", "Deliverables and feasibility": "Reusable prompt library (\u224812 templates), schema pack, hybrid evaluation scorecard, quality checklist; sandboxed, review-ready outputs instead of \u201cproduction.\u201d", "Technical integration": "Demonstrated medium-level mastery with structured outputs, evaluation sets, and verification chains while ensuring progress with feature fallbacks."}, {"Idea 7": "Data\u2011to\u2011Decision (Improved)", "Improvements applied": "Curated case studies with known quirks; simplified stats to core comparisons; explicit validation prompts and human sign-offs; fallback paths if ADA unavailable; decision checklists and clear deliverable scope.", "Step-by-step exemplar": "Data audit, clean/join with mismatch export, core analysis (pivots, regression-lite), chart spec prompting, insight tree + executive narrative, sensitivity checks, reproducible re-run template.", "Deliverables and feasibility": "ADA notebook-style thread, cleaned dataset, charts, executive report, validation checklist, re-run instructions; balanced rigor with time constraints.", "Technical integration": "ADA-centric pipeline with structured logging, CSV/JSON exports, and reproducible prompts; human-in-the-loop checkpoints to mitigate misuse."}, {"Idea 8": "Final Selection and Rationale", "Selected course": "Prompt\u2011to\u2011Production: ChatGPT Power\u2011User Proficiency for Professionals (No Code).", "Rationale": "Best cross\u2011functional fit; teaches universally applicable skills (prompt framing, context control, structured outputs, verification) with clear deliverables and immediate workplace utility\u2014without requiring coding.", "Technical depth": "Integrates Custom Instructions/Memory, file uploads, schema-guarded outputs with self\u2011repair, Compare, Browsing for source-backed verification, ADA for mini eval sets; includes fallbacks where features are unavailable.", "Feasibility and pedagogy": "Timeboxed labs, prebuilt assets, hybrid evaluation, and a compliance/PII mini\u2011module address earlier critiques on scope, bias, and governance; outputs are sandboxed and stakeholder\u2011review ready.", "Outcome alignment": "Learners leave with a prompt library, schema pack, and evaluation kit\u2014actionable frameworks that reflect medium-level ChatGPT capabilities and real-world constraints."}]
