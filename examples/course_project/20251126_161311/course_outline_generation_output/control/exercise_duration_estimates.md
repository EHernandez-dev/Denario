# Exercise Duration Estimates for Hands-On Modules

A careful review of the proposed course modules reveals that hands-on exercises and labs are integral to the learning experience, particularly in modules focused on prompt engineering, output evaluation, advanced features, domain customization, collaborative use, and strategic planning. Below is an analysis of which modules include practical exercises, recommended time allocations, and the pedagogical rationale for each.

## Modules with Hands-On Exercises or Labs

### 3. Prompt Engineering: Crafting Effective Inputs
- **Exercise Duration:** 25 minutes
- **Debrief:** 10 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Prompt engineering is a core operational skill that benefits from iterative experimentation. Allocating 25 minutes allows participants to try multiple prompt variations, observe differences in outputs, and refine their approach. The 10-minute debrief supports group reflection and sharing of best practices, reinforcing learning through peer discussion.

### 4. Evaluating and Refining AI Outputs
- **Exercise Duration:** 20 minutes
- **Debrief:** 10 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Critical evaluation requires exposure to a range of AI outputs and the opportunity to practice identifying errors, biases, and areas for improvement. Twenty minutes is sufficient for participants to review several examples and apply iterative refinement techniques. The debrief consolidates lessons learned and highlights common pitfalls.

### 5. Advanced Features: Plugins, Extensions, and Integrations
- **Exercise Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Debrief:** 10 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Exploring plugins and integrations involves multiple steps: enabling features, configuring settings, and applying them to real tasks. Thirty minutes provides ample time for hands-on exploration of at least two advanced features (e.g., web browsing plugin, Google Workspace integration). The debrief ensures participants can troubleshoot and share discoveries.

### 6. Customizing ChatGPT for Domain-Specific Tasks
- **Exercise Duration:** 25 minutes
- **Debrief:** 10 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Domain customization is best learned through direct application to participants’ own professional contexts. Twenty-five minutes allows for prompt adaptation, workflow design, and initial testing. The debrief supports cross-domain knowledge transfer and discussion of best practices.

### 7. Collaborative and Group Use of ChatGPT
- **Exercise Duration:** 20 minutes
- **Debrief:** 10 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Group activities require coordination and shared task execution. Twenty minutes is appropriate for small teams to brainstorm, co-author a document, or solve a problem using ChatGPT. The debrief enables teams to present outcomes and reflect on collaborative dynamics.

### 8. Strategic Planning and Responsible AI Adoption
- **Exercise Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Debrief:** 15 minutes
- **Rationale:**  
  Strategic planning is a capstone activity that synthesizes course content. Thirty minutes allows participants to draft a personalized or team-based AI adoption plan, considering ethical and practical factors. The extended debrief (15 minutes) supports sharing of strategic roadmaps and peer feedback, fostering a sense of closure and actionable next steps.

## Modules Without Dedicated Hands-On Exercises

- **1. Introduction to ChatGPT and Conversational AI**
- **2. Navigating the ChatGPT Interface and Core Features**

These modules are primarily conceptual and orientation-focused. While they may include short demonstrations or guided walkthroughs, they do not require standalone hands-on labs. Any interactive elements are embedded within the instructional flow and do not necessitate separate time allocation.
