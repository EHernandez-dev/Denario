Introductory modules will cover all necessary foundational knowledge.\n\n- **Technical Background**\n  - No programming or advanced technical skills are required. However, participants with experience in workflow automation, API usage, or data analysis may find it easier to engage with advanced modules (e.g., API integration, plugin use).\n\n### Summary Table: Prerequisites\n\n| Prerequisite Type      | Requirement                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Digital Literacy      | Mandatory: Comfortable with web apps and digital tools                                       |\n| Business Acumen       | Mandatory: Foundational understanding of business operations                                 |\n| English Proficiency   | Mandatory: Able to read, write, and communicate in English                                   |\n| AI Concepts           | Optional: Basic familiarity with AI/ML concepts                                              |\n| ChatGPT Experience    | Optional: Prior use of ChatGPT or similar tools                                              |\n| Technical Background  | Optional: Experience with automation, APIs, or data analysis                                 |\n\n---\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that all participants can engage meaningfully with the course content, while optional background knowledge may accelerate learning in advanced modules.
