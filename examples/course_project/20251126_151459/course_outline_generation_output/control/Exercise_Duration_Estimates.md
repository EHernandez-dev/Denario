# Exercise Duration Estimates for Hands-On Modules

A careful estimation of exercise durations is essential to ensure that participants have sufficient time to engage deeply with each hands-on activity, while also allowing for meaningful debriefs and knowledge consolidation. The following analysis provides rationale and justification for the proposed durations in each module of the "ChatGPT Premium Unlocked: Tools and Techniques for Business Excellence" course.

## 1. Introduction to ChatGPT Premium for Business

**Exercise:** Guided walkthrough of the ChatGPT Premium interface and feature set  
**Duration:** 10 minutes, Debrief: 5 minutes

**Rationale:**  
This introductory exercise is designed to familiarize participants with the interface and basic navigation. As the activity is primarily observational and exploratory, 10 minutes is sufficient for participants to follow along, ask clarifying questions, and gain initial comfort. A brief 5-minute debrief allows for immediate clarification and sets the stage for deeper engagement in subsequent modules.

## 2. Advanced Prompt Engineering and Custom Instructions

**Exercise:** Hands-on prompt engineering workshop using real business scenarios  
**Duration:** 20 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

**Rationale:**  
Prompt engineering and custom instructions require iterative experimentation and peer discussion. Allocating 20 minutes enables participants to craft, test, and refine multiple prompts, as well as configure custom instructions for different business contexts. The 10-minute debrief supports group sharing of strategies and troubleshooting, reinforcing learning through collaborative reflection.

## 3. Execution Flows: Automating Business Processes

**Exercise:** Group activity: Build and deploy an execution flow for a sample business process  
**Duration:** 30 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

**Rationale:**  
Designing and implementing execution flows is a complex, multi-step process that benefits from collaborative problem-solving. A 30-minute window allows groups to map a business process, construct the execution flow, test for errors, and iterate as needed. The 10-minute debrief is essential for surfacing common challenges, sharing optimization tips, and consolidating workflow design principles.

## 4. Integrating Business Data and External Tools

**Exercise:** Individual exercise: Analyze a provided dataset using ChatGPT’s data tools  
**Duration:** 25 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

**Rationale:**  
Working with business data and advanced tools such as the Code Interpreter requires time for file uploads, data exploration, and synthesis of insights. 25 minutes ensures participants can complete a full analysis cycle, including troubleshooting and interpretation of results. The 10-minute debrief enables sharing of findings and discussion of best practices for data-driven decision-making.

## 5. Real-World Business Applications and Case Studies

**Exercise:** Small group discussion and presentation of case study analyses  
**Duration:** 20 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

**Rationale:**  
Case study analysis involves reading, discussion, and collaborative solution design. 20 minutes allows groups to analyze the scenario, identify relevant ChatGPT features, and prepare a brief presentation. The 10-minute debrief supports cross-group learning and highlights diverse approaches to business challenges.

## 6. Ethical and Responsible AI in Business

**Exercise:** Scenario-based group discussion on ethical dilemmas and policy drafting  
**Duration:** 15 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

**Rationale:**  
Ethical scenario analysis is best conducted in small groups to encourage diverse perspectives. 15 minutes is sufficient for groups to discuss scenarios, identify risks, and draft preliminary guidelines. The 10-minute debrief is critical for surfacing key ethical considerations and synthesizing group recommendations into actionable frameworks.

## 7. Capstone Simulation: From Tool to Business Impact

**Exercise:** Team-based simulation: Design, implement, and present a business solution using ChatGPT Premium  
**Duration:** 40 minutes, Debrief: 15 minutes

**Rationale:**  
The capstone simulation is the most comprehensive exercise, requiring teams to integrate all learned tools and techniques in a realistic business scenario. 40 minutes provides adequate time for scoping, solution design, implementation, and preparation of a brief presentation. The extended 15-minute debrief allows for team presentations, peer feedback, and instructor synthesis, ensuring that learning is consolidated and directly linked to business impact.
