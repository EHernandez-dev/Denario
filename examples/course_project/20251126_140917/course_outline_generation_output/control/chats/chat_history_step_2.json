Identification of Prerequisite Knowledge and Experience\n\nGiven the course is designed for business professionals aiming to integrate ChatGPT into their communication and collaboration workflows, the following prerequisites are identified:\n\n#### a. Basic Digital Literacy\n- **Description:** Participants should be comfortable using computers, web browsers, and common business productivity tools (e.g., email, word processors, collaboration platforms).\n- **Rationale:** Ensures participants can navigate ChatGPT interfaces and participate in digital exercises.\n\n#### b. Foundational Business Communication Skills\n- **Description:** Participants should have experience with standard business communication formats (emails, memos, meeting notes) and basic collaboration practices.\n- **Rationale:** Provides context for applying ChatGPT to real-world business scenarios.\n\n#### c. No Prior AI or Programming Experience Required\n- **Description:** The course is accessible to those without technical or AI backgrounds.\n- **Rationale:** The curriculum is designed to introduce AI concepts from the ground up, focusing on practical application rather than technical implementation.\n\n#### d. English Language Proficiency\n- **Description:** Participants should have working proficiency in English, as course materials, ChatGPT interactions, and group activities will be conducted in English.\n- **Rationale:** Ensures effective participation and comprehension.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Correlation of Prerequisites with Course Modules\n\nTo address potential knowledge gaps and ensure all participants are prepared for advanced content, the following correlations are established:\n\n#### Module 1: Introduction to ChatGPT and AI in Business Communication\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** This module explicitly addresses any gaps in AI familiarity, digital literacy, and sets the stage for all subsequent modules. It introduces ChatGPT\u2019s interface, basic concepts, and business relevance.\n- **Mitigation:** Participants with limited AI exposure will be brought up to speed through foundational explanations and hands-on orientation.\n\n#### Module 2: Fundamentals of Prompt Crafting\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** Builds on digital literacy and business communication skills. No advanced technical knowledge is assumed.\n- **Mitigation:** Step-by-step guidance and examples ensure accessibility for those less familiar with structured writing or prompt engineering.\n\n#### Module 3: Context Management and Multi-Turn Conversations\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** Relies on understanding from Module 1 and 2. No additional prerequisites.\n- **Mitigation:** Interactive exercises reinforce concepts for participants with varying levels of experience.\n\n#### Module 4: Applying ChatGPT to Real-World Business Scenarios\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** Assumes participants are familiar with basic business communication tasks. Any gaps are addressed through scenario-based learning and peer collaboration.\n- **Mitigation:** Group activities and role-plays provide scaffolding for those less experienced in certain business contexts.\n\n#### Module 5: Advanced Features and Customization\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** Builds on foundational modules. No prior experience with advanced AI features is required.\n- **Mitigation:** Demonstrations and guided practice ensure all participants can engage with advanced tools regardless of prior exposure.\n\n#### Module 6: Responsible AI Use, Trust, and Accountability\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** No specific prerequisites; ethical and responsible use is introduced in an accessible manner.\n- **Mitigation:** Case studies and discussions are designed for broad accessibility.\n\n#### Module 7: Collaborative Practice and Peer Feedback\n- **Prerequisite Coverage:** Relies on skills developed in previous modules. No additional prerequisites.\n- **Mitigation:** Structured feedback and reflection activities support all participants in consolidating learning.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Recommendations for Course Onboarding\n\n- **Pre-course Survey:** Assess participant comfort with digital tools and business communication to identify any additional support needs.\n- **Optional Pre-reading:** Provide a brief primer on AI in business and digital communication basics for those who wish to prepare in advance.\n- **Early Module Emphasis:** Ensure Module 1 is sufficiently comprehensive to level-set all participants, regardless of background.\n\n---\n\nThis prerequisite analysis ensures that the course is accessible to a broad range of business professionals, while also providing mechanisms to address and bridge any knowledge gaps early in the learning journey.",
