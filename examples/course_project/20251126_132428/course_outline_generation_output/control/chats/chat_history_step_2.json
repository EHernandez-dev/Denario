Knowledge and Experience\n\n- **General Business Acumen:**  \n  Participants should possess a foundational understanding of business operations, processes, and decision-making. This includes familiarity with common business functions such as marketing, sales, operations, finance, or strategy.\n\n- **Digital Literacy:**  \n  Basic proficiency with digital tools (e.g., web browsers, office productivity software, cloud-based platforms) is required. Participants should be comfortable navigating online interfaces and managing digital files.\n\n- **Data Awareness:**  \n  While no advanced data analysis or coding skills are required, participants should be able to interpret basic business data (e.g., spreadsheets, charts, simple reports) and understand the value of data-driven decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Familiarity with AI and Automation\n\n- **Introductory AI Concepts (Recommended, Not Required):**  \n  Prior exposure to AI concepts (such as chatbots, automation, or machine learning) is helpful but not mandatory. The course will provide foundational context for those new to AI in business.\n\n- **No Coding Required:**  \n  The course is designed for non-technical professionals; no programming or advanced technical background is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Attitudinal and Mindset Prerequisites\n\n- **Openness to Ethical and Responsible AI Use:**  \n  Participants should be willing to engage in discussions about the ethical implications of AI, including data privacy, bias, and responsible deployment.\n\n- **Willingness to Experiment and Learn by Doing:**  \n  A proactive, hands-on approach is encouraged. Participants should be prepared to engage in simulations, role-play, and interactive exercises.\n\n- **Change Management Readiness:**  \n  As the course addresses integrating AI tools into business workflows, participants should be open to exploring new ways of working and advocating for responsible change within their organizations.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
