No technical background is required. Across 10 scaffolded modules, participants will progress from foundational prompt engineering to advanced context management, leveraging explicit ChatGPT tools and features. The course emphasizes practical exercises, actionable feedback, and iterative improvement for immediate workplace application.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to ChatGPT and Generative AI\n### Description:\nThis foundational module introduces the core concepts of generative AI, focusing on ChatGPT\u2019s architecture, capabilities, and limitations. It orients participants to the ChatGPT interface and highlights key features, setting the stage for effective and responsible use.\n- **Scope:** Introductory; establishes baseline understanding and context.\n- **Rationale:** Provides essential background for all subsequent modules.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Foundations of Prompt Engineering\n### Description:\nParticipants learn the principles of prompt engineering, including prompt clarity, specificity, and structure. The session explores how prompt design influences ChatGPT\u2019s outputs, with hands-on experimentation.\n- **Scope:** Foundational; builds prompt literacy.\n- **Rationale:** Equips participants with the basic skills needed for all further prompt-based work.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Navigating ChatGPT Tools and Features\n### Description:\nThis module provides hands-on exploration of ChatGPT\u2019s toolset, including the Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis), File Uploads, Custom Instructions, and GPTs (custom bots). Participants practice selecting and using these features for different tasks.\n- **Scope:** Technical; tool orientation and practical navigation.\n- **Rationale:** Ensures participants can access and utilize the full range of ChatGPT functionalities.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Iterative Prompt Refinement and Feedback Loops\n### Description:\nParticipants develop skills in iterative prompt development, using feedback loops and conversation history to improve output quality. The session emphasizes prompt evaluation and revision.\n- **Scope:** Applied; introduces iterative improvement.\n- **Rationale:** Builds on prompt engineering, introducing feedback-driven refinement.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Context Layering and Memory Management\n### Description:\nThis advanced module covers techniques for managing and layering context in multi-turn conversations, including summarization and the use of persistent memory features (where available).\n- **Scope:** Advanced; context management and continuity.\n- **Rationale:** Extends prompt skills to complex, multi-step tasks and longer interactions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Advanced Prompt Engineering: Role Assignment and System Prompts\n### Description:\nParticipants explore advanced prompt engineering, including role assignment, system prompts, and persona creation to guide ChatGPT\u2019s behavior and tone for specialized applications.\n- **Scope:** Advanced; behavioral control and customization.\n- **Rationale:** Builds on context management, enabling tailored and consistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Real-World Applications and Workflow Integration\n### Description:\nThis module focuses on integrating ChatGPT into daily workflows, such as document drafting, data analysis, brainstorming, and research, with practical use cases and best practices.\n- **Scope:** Applied; productivity and workflow enhancement.\n- **Rationale:** Demonstrates practical value and real-world application of previous skills.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Evaluating and Troubleshooting ChatGPT Outputs\n### Description:\nParticipants learn to critically evaluate ChatGPT outputs, identify errors, biases, and hallucinations, and apply troubleshooting strategies, including the use of external validation tools.\n- **Scope:** Applied; quality assurance and risk mitigation.\n- **Rationale:** Ensures responsible and reliable use of ChatGPT in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Custom GPTs and Automation\n### Description:\nThis module introduces the creation and deployment of custom GPTs (custom bots) using the ChatGPT platform, focusing on configuration, testing, and workflow automation.\n- **Scope:** Advanced; automation and customization.\n- **Rationale:** Leverages all prior skills for specialized, automated solutions.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Capstone: End-to-End Project and Peer Review\n### Description:\nIn the final module, participants apply all learned skills to a comprehensive, real-world project, designing and refining a ChatGPT-powered solution, followed by structured peer review and feedback.\n- **Scope:** Integrative; synthesis and demonstration.\n- **Rationale:** Provides an opportunity for holistic application and peer learning.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale for Sequence:**\n- The course begins with foundational knowledge and skills, ensuring all participants have a shared baseline.\n- Tool orientation follows, so participants can fully engage with hands-on exercises.\n- Iterative refinement and context management build technical depth, while advanced prompt engineering introduces behavioral control.\n- Real-world application and troubleshooting ensure practical utility and responsible use.\n- Custom GPTs and the capstone project synthesize all skills, culminating in independent, confident deployment.\n\nThis sequence ensures a logical, scaffolded progression from basic to advanced mastery, with each module building directly on the competencies established in the previous sessions.",
