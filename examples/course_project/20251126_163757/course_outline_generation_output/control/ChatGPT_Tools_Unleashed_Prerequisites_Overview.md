# Prerequisites and Technological Familiarity for "ChatGPT Tools Unleashed: A Professional's Guide"

## Overview

To ensure that participants can fully engage with the intensive, hands-on nature of this 3-day course, it is essential to define clear prerequisites. These prerequisites will help establish a common baseline, facilitate effective pacing, and maximize learning outcomes. The following analysis outlines the necessary technical, conceptual, and experiential requirements, as well as an assessment of the expected technological familiarity of the target audience.

## 1. Technical Prerequisites

### a. Basic Computer Literacy
- Proficiency in navigating operating systems (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Familiarity with web browsers and web-based applications.

### b. Internet and Cloud Services
- Experience using cloud-based productivity tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365).
- Ability to manage files, folders, and basic settings in cloud environments.

### c. Foundational Programming Knowledge (Recommended, Not Mandatory)
- Understanding of basic programming concepts (variables, functions, data types).
- Prior exposure to scripting languages (preferably Python) is advantageous for automation modules, but not strictly required.
- Ability to read and modify simple code snippets.

### d. API and Integration Awareness (Introductory Level)
- General understanding of what an API is and how it is used to connect applications.
- No prior experience with the OpenAI API or similar APIs is required, but familiarity with RESTful APIs is beneficial.

## 4. Assessment of Technological Familiarity

### a. Target Audience Profile
- Professionals from diverse backgrounds (operations, project management, IT, HR, business analysis, etc.).
- Likely to have experience with digital productivity suites and some exposure to automation or integration tools, but not necessarily with APIs or programming.

### b. Verification and Adjustment
- A pre-course survey or self-assessment checklist will be provided to gauge participants’ familiarity with:
    - Basic programming concepts
    - API usage
    - Workflow automation tools
- Based on survey results, optional pre-course resources (e.g., short tutorials on Python basics, API fundamentals, or Zapier walkthroughs) will be recommended to ensure all participants reach the required baseline.
