## Prerequisites for "Mastering Prompt Frameworks for Business Efficiency"

### Foundational Knowledge and Experience

- **General Business Acumen:** Participants should possess a basic understanding of common business processes, such as project management, communication workflows, and decision-making scenarios. This ensures relevance and applicability of prompt frameworks to real-world business tasks.
- **Familiarity with Digital Tools:** Comfort with standard office productivity software (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets, email platforms) is recommended, as exercises may reference these environments for practical application.
- **Interest in AI-Driven Solutions:** While no advanced technical background is required, participants should have an interest in leveraging AI tools to enhance productivity and efficiency in business contexts.

### AI Concepts and Prompting

- **Basic Awareness of AI Capabilities:** Participants should be aware of what AI language models (such as ChatGPT or similar tools) can and cannot do, including their use in generating text, summarizing information, and supporting business tasks.
- **Introductory Understanding of Prompts:** Prior exposure to the concept of prompts—simple instructions or questions given to AI systems to elicit responses—is beneficial. Participants should ideally have experimented with basic prompt interactions (e.g., asking an AI to draft an email or summarize a document).

### Recommended Pre-Course Preparation

- **Review of AI Prompt Interactions:** Participants are encouraged to review introductory materials or tutorials on interacting with AI language models. This may include:
  - Watching a short video or reading a guide on how to input prompts and interpret AI responses.
  - Completing a brief self-guided exercise using a public AI chatbot to gain familiarity with prompt-response dynamics.
- **Familiarity with Business Scenarios:** Reflecting on typical business challenges or tasks where AI assistance could be valuable (e.g., report writing, customer communication, data analysis) will help participants contextualize course exercises.

### No Coding or Advanced Technical Skills Required

- The course is designed for a non-technical audience. No programming, data science, or advanced AI knowledge is necessary.
- All frameworks and exercises will use simplified language and practical, business-oriented examples.
