This could help clarify distinct areas of focus for the course outline.\n\n\u2022 In Step 2, include a suggestion for the researcher to specify not only knowledge requirements but also any attitudinal or mindset prerequisites (such as openness to ethical discussions or change management), helping to set clear participant expectations.\n\n\u2022 For Step 3, advise the researcher to ensure that the proposed modules explicitly cover the key interactive elements (such as simulations and role-play scenarios) mentioned in the course idea. This will ensure that the hands-on aspects are well-integrated throughout the sequence of modules.\n\n\u2022 In Step 4, recommend that the researcher incorporate examples or templates for writing learning goals (using the \u201cParticipants [action verb]\u2026\u201d format) to enhance clarity and consistency across modules. Mentioning the importance of aligning key takeaways with these goals could be beneficial too.\n\n\u2022 For Step 5, suggest that the researcher not only estimate exercise durations but also briefly justify the time allocation (e.g., linking time estimates to the complexity or expected interaction level of the module). This will provide a clearer rationale for the hands-on schedule.\n\n\u2022 In Step 6, propose that the researcher cross-reference the compiled information with the entire course flow to verify that prerequisites, competencies, modules, and interactive elements are coherently structured in the final markdown outline. This step will help ensure consistency and logical progression throughout the course outline.\n\nThese recommendations aim to enhance clarity, specificity, and consistency across all steps in the plan without adding extra steps.",
