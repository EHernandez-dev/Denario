This ensures they can access ChatGPT tools and participate in hands-on exercises without technical barriers.\n- **Familiarity with Common Business Software:** Experience with standard productivity tools (e.g., email clients, word processors, spreadsheets, and collaboration platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams) is recommended. This background will help participants contextualize ChatGPT integrations and applications within their daily workflows.\n\n### Technical Prerequisites\n\n- **No Coding or Programming Required:** The course is designed for non-technical users. There is no expectation of prior coding, scripting, or software development experience.\n- **Basic Understanding of Digital Workflows:** Participants should have a general awareness of how digital tools and processes are used to support business operations, such as document management, communication flows, and task automation.\n\n### Business Context Prerequisites\n\n- **Experience in a Business Environment:** Participants should have some professional experience in a business setting, such as administration, management, customer service, or project coordination. This ensures relevance when discussing business use cases and workflow integration.\n- **Awareness of Business Processes:** A foundational understanding of how business processes are structured and managed (e.g., project management, customer support, internal communications) will help participants identify opportunities for ChatGPT adoption.\n\n### Baseline Familiarity with AI Concepts\n\n- **Introductory Awareness of AI:** While no deep technical knowledge is required, participants should have a basic awareness of what artificial intelligence is and its general applications in business. This could be as simple as having read articles or attended briefings on AI trends.\n- **Openness to New Technologies:** A willingness to experiment with and adopt new digital tools is important for maximizing the course\u2019s practical value.\n\n### Summary Table of Prerequisites\n\n| Area                        | Prerequisite Description                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Computer Skills             | Basic web navigation, file management, and use of productivity software                 |\n| Technical Knowledge         | No coding required; general understanding of digital workflows                          |\n| Business Experience         | Some experience in a business or organizational context                                 |\n| Business Process Awareness  | Familiarity with common business processes and communication practices                   |\n| AI Familiarity              | Introductory awareness of AI concepts and openness to technology adoption               |\n\n### Rationale\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that participants can fully engage with the course content, participate in hands-on exercises, and contextualize ChatGPT tools within their own business environments.
