Step 4 mock-teach and rubric favored idea03 after rebalancing time into Vision/OCR (4:00) and Governance/Redaction (3:30), reducing failures and ensuring reliable delivery within 24 hours.\n\t\t- Positioning statement:\n\t\t- - Target roles: Legal operations, HR/compliance, procurement/AP, support/documentation teams, product/program managers processing PDFs, scans, and tables.\n\t\t- - Minimum prerequisites: Basic ChatGPT familiarity; comfort with PDFs/CSVs; willingness to use synthetic/redacted data; no coding required.\n\t\t- - Measurable outcomes: Learners will (1) extract tables from PDFs/scans with \u226595% completeness on course docs; (2) normalize/QA CSVs with a documented change log; (3) build a Knowledge-backed Q&A with proper abstention and page/line citations \u226590% of test cases; (4) configure an enterprise-safe workflow (retention, audit logs, access roles) and pass the governance checklist; (5) deliver a 2-page decision memo citing artifacts and QA metrics.\n\t\t- 3-line elevator pitch:\n\t\t- - Go from prompt fundamentals to reliable, enterprise-safe document pipelines\u2014extraction with Vision/OCR, normalization with ADA, and Knowledge-backed Q&A\u2014no code required.\n\t\t- - Practice on \u201cdirty\u201d scans, handle edge cases, and prove accuracy with QA checklists and measurable rubrics.\n\t\t- - Leave with a capstone doc-to-decision workflow, SOP, and governance plan ready for your team.\n\t\t- Instructor notes:\n\t\t- - Cohort size and facilitation: Ideal class size 18\u201324 learners; recommended facilitator-to-learner ratio 1:8 for labs (1 lead instructor + 1\u20132 TAs). Allocate extra TA time during Module 2 (Vision/OCR) and Module 7 (Governance/Redaction) where troubleshooting peaks.\n\t\t- - Hardware/software: Modern browser (Chrome/Edge), stable broadband (\u226525 Mbps), headset; 8+ GB RAM recommended. Accounts: ChatGPT Plus or Teams/Enterprise with Vision, ADA, and Custom GPT Builder enabled; if features vary, provide instructor demo tenant. Preload synthetic doc pack; disable external connectors for the workshop workspace.\n\t\t- Enterprise customization:\n\t\t- - Regulated domain swaps/deepens:\n\t\t- \u2022 Finance: Emphasize invoice/statement extraction and SOX-aligned control mapping; expand Module 3 normalization rules for currencies, GL mapping; add audit-trail export in Module 7.\n\t\t- \u2022 Health: Insert 45\u201360 min de-identification micro-lab before Module 2; strengthen PHI rules, DLP quarantine, and abstention behaviors in Knowledge Q&A.\n\t\t- \u2022 Legal: Deepen Module 4 with clause-level diffing (change taxonomy, risk scoring) and privilege hygiene; add citation rigor and evidence logs.\n\t\t- - Optional add-on micro-modules (no-code):\n\t\t- \u2022 Advanced Knowledge Retrieval QA (2 hours): multi-file curation, page/line grounding tests, abstain patterns; outcome: \u226595% grounded answers on a 10-question suite.\n\t\t- \u2022 No-Code Actions via Structured Outputs (3 hours): stable JSON schemas and downstream \u201cmock consumer\u201d handoffs; outcome: valid schema + sample handoff SOP.\n\t\t- \u2022 DLP, Retention, and Audit Ops (2 hours): configure retention (14\u201390 days), export audit logs, create monitoring SOP; outcome: completed governance pack.\n\t\t- \u2022 Complex Table Normalization in ADA (3 hours): merges, pivots, and outlier detection; outcome: normalized.csv + anomaly report.\n\t\t- \u2022 Browse Hygiene for Regulatory References (1.5 hours): recency checks, citation formatting, approved-source list; outcome: sourced brief with access dates.\n\t\t- Templates and artifacts:\n\t\t- - Files confirmed: idea03_syllabus.csv updated per Step 4 rebalance (M2=4:00, M7=3:30, M1=2:30, M4=2:30); rubric.csv carries final pass thresholds; idea03_changelog.md updated with selection rationale and governance audit notes.\n\t\t- - Artifact naming: module02_line_items.csv, module03_normalized.csv, module05_test_log.csv, module07_privacy_checklist.md, capstone_decision_memo.docx; dataset pack names unchanged (invoice_scans.zip, normalization_rules.csv, policy_v1.pdf/v2.pdf, policy_glossary.csv).\n\t\t- - Risk mitigations: If Builder disabled, simulate Knowledge-backed Q&A in base ChatGPT with files; if ADA limits hit, chunk CSVs and process batches; enforce \u201cno PHI/PII\u201d + synthetic/redacted data gate before any uploads.\n\n        ",
