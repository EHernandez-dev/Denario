Web-Grounded Research with Browse\n### Description:\nImplements a defensible research workflow using Browse that prioritizes recency, credibility, and cross-verification. Participants cite only opened sources, add access dates, and maintain a structured source log to ensure transparency and auditability in enterprise contexts.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Transparent browsing workflow with traceable citations\n- Practical heuristics for recency, credibility, and relevance\n- A structured sources log aligned to review and compliance norms\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants open and evaluate at least three reputable sources from the last 12 months and extract quotes with metadata.\n- Participants produce a one-page brief using inline bracketed citations and a references list with access dates.\n- Participants maintain a sources log (title, URL, credibility notes) and verify one-to-one mapping between citations and references.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 80 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n## 4. Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros\n### Description:\nUses ADA to analyze multi-file CSVs, perform joins, compute KPIs, visualize results, and write a concise, assumption-transparent narrative with outlier flags. Includes a spreadsheet-based fallback (pseudo-calculations + visual spec) if ADA is unavailable, preserving rigor and reproducibility.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A reproducible join\u2013transform\u2013visualize pipeline\n- Portable KPI tables and charts for stakeholder consumption\n- A concise, assumption-transparent narrative with outlier detection\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants join sales_q1_q4.csv with targets.csv on quarter; compute revenue variance and units per product.\n- Participants export a KPI table (CSV) and a labeled chart (PNG) with correct currency formatting.\n- Participants author a maximum 150-word summary that states assumptions and flags outliers beyond two standard deviations.\n- Participants compare ADA outputs to a spreadsheet fallback for coherence if ADA is unavailable.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n## 5. Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)\n### Description:\nApplies Vision to locate and extract target tables (PDF and image), normalize structure, and validate numeric integrity with ADA. Emphasizes OCR uncertainty management, clarifying questions on ambiguous cells, cropping/re-upload for skewed images, and a five-check QA report with pass/fail outcomes and corrections.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Reliable table extraction and normalization workflow using Vision\n- Numeric validation and reconciliation via ADA\n- Transparent QA and error logging practice suitable for audit\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants extract the \u201cCoverage limits\u201d table from a PDF and a skewed image, preserving header integrity in a CSV export.\n- Participants validate totals and ranges with ADA and record corrections and decisions in a QA report with at least five checks.\n- Participants apply crop/re-upload and, if necessary, manual reconciliation steps, documenting interventions clearly.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n## 6. Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows\n### Description:\nCombines Vision-based brand guide parsing with Image Generation to produce on-brief assets that satisfy brand and accessibility constraints. Participants generate and refine comps, verify color contrast ratios, write alt-text, and provide rationale connecting design choices to brand rules.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A lightweight brand-to-asset pipeline integrating Vision + Image Generation\n- Accessibility embedded in review (contrast ratios, alt-text)\n- Rationale discipline linking visuals to brand constraints\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants use Vision to extract palette and constraints from Brand_Guide.pdf and reflect them in two final images.\n- Participants generate three comps, refine to two final assets, and avoid disallowed content (e.g., photorealistic people if prohibited).\n- Participants author a concise rationale and an accessibility checklist including alt-text and contrast flags against WCAG AA expectations.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 90 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n## 7. Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (simulated)\n### Description:\nConstructs a task-specific assistant using Custom GPT Builder with a precise RTCFCE system prompt and Knowledge files, enforcing Knowledge-only citations and \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d behavior when content is absent. Simulates a no-code Action via structured JSON output suitable for downstream tools and drafts a GPT Store listing mock; includes a base-ChatGPT simulation fallback if Builder is unavailable.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- Working Custom GPT scaffold with guardrails and Knowledge-only citations\n- Retrieval QA log with citation integrity and confidence reporting\n- Parseable JSON output pattern enabling lightweight automation\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants create an unlisted \u201cTeam FAQ Assistant\u201d that cites only from Knowledge files with page/line and declines when absent.\n- Participants upload Product_FAQ.docx, Policy_Guide.pdf, and glossary.csv; test at least five questions and log retrieval fidelity.\n- Participants output both a human-readable answer and a JSON block with fields for answer, citations, and confidence; prepare a store listing mock including governance notes.\n- Participants execute a base-ChatGPT simulation with file uploads if Builder is disabled, preserving the structured output behavior.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n## 8. Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n### Description:\nOperationalizes privacy, data controls, and workspace sharing settings in Teams/Enterprise and executes an end-to-end capstone that integrates at least three tools (for example, Vision + ADA + Browse) using synthetic/redacted data. Delivers a formal SOP, governance checklist, RACI, and measurable acceptance criteria ready for enterprise review.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A governance-compliant, SOP-backed end-to-end workflow\n- RACI roles and acceptance criteria that enable replication\n- A practical privacy posture for ongoing enterprise use\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants review and document relevant Teams/Enterprise settings (retention, data controls, workspace sharing) in the capstone SOP.\n- Participants run an end-to-end, cross-tool flow using at least three tools and only synthetic/redacted inputs, producing all artifacts.\n- Participants deliver a complete SOP with steps, tools, risks, privacy controls, a RACI table, and measurable acceptance criteria.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 110 minutes, Debrief: 30 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Further resources for organizers\n- OpenAI Help Center (Teams/Enterprise, ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom GPTs, GPT Store): https://help.openai.com\n- OpenAI Policies (privacy, data usage, safety): https://openai.com/policies\n- OpenAI Cookbook (prompt patterns, analysis workflows): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\n- WCAG 2.1 (contrast and alt-text standards): https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n\n## Further resources for participants\n- Getting started with Browse, ADA, and Vision in ChatGPT: https://help.openai.com\n- Prompt engineering basics (OpenAI Cookbook): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- Responsible AI use in the workplace (OpenAI policies): https://openai.com/policies\n- W3C WAI tutorials (contrast and alt-text): https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n- Purdue OWL (research and citation primer): https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/overview.html",
