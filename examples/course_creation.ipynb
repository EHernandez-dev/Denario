      "\n",
      "• In Step 4, recommend that the researcher incorporates both concise module descriptions and explicitly defined learning goals that use actionable verbs (e.g., \"Participants will analyze,\" \"Participants will implement\"). This helps in aligning course takeaways with business applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Regarding Step 5, advise the researcher to detail the exercise durations clearly and specify which modules require hands-on activities. This will help structure the overall course timing and ensure practical sessions are well-balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Lastly, in Step 6, ask the researcher to double-check the markdown formatting to ensure a clear, organized presentation. Emphasize a logical layout that precisely compiles the module descriptions, learning goals, takeaways, and exercise durations into a professional-looking outline.\n",
