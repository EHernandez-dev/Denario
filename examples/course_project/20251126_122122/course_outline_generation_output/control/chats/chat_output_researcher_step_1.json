These competencies span both hard (technical) and soft (cognitive and interpersonal) domains, ensuring participants can not only operate the tools but also critically and collaboratively apply them in real-world business contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Hard Competencies\n\n### 1. ChatGPT Tool Proficiency\n- **Navigating ChatGPT interfaces:** Ability to access, configure, and utilize ChatGPT via web, desktop, or integrated business platforms.\n- **Understanding core features:** Familiarity with functionalities such as conversation history, prompt templates, file uploads, and plugin/add-on usage.\n- **Utilizing advanced features:** Competence in leveraging features like custom instructions, memory, and integration with external data sources or APIs (where applicable).\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering\n- **Formulating effective prompts:** Skill in crafting clear, specific, and goal-oriented prompts to elicit desired outputs.\n- **Iterative refinement:** Ability to adjust and optimize prompts based on ChatGPT\u2019s responses for improved accuracy and relevance.\n- **Template creation:** Developing reusable prompt templates for recurring business tasks (e.g., report generation, email drafting).\n\n### 3. Workflow Integration\n- **Identifying automation opportunities:** Recognizing business processes where ChatGPT can streamline tasks (e.g., meeting summaries, data extraction, content drafting).\n- **Embedding ChatGPT in daily operations:** Applying ChatGPT to routine workflows, such as scheduling, research, and customer communication.\n- **Evaluating tool fit:** Assessing when and how to use ChatGPT versus other productivity tools.\n\n---\n\n## Soft Competencies\n\n### 1. Critical Evaluation\n- **Assessing output quality:** Judging the accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of ChatGPT-generated content.\n- **Recognizing limitations and biases:** Identifying when ChatGPT\u2019s responses may be incomplete, incorrect, or biased, and knowing how to verify information.\n- **Ethical and responsible use:** Understanding privacy, data security, and ethical considerations in deploying AI tools in business contexts.\n\n### 2. Communication\n- **Translating business needs into prompts:** Effectively articulating business objectives and requirements in a way that ChatGPT can process.\n- **Interpreting and presenting results:** Communicating AI-generated insights or content to colleagues and stakeholders in a clear, actionable manner.\n\n### 3. Collaboration and Change Management\n- **Facilitating team adoption:** Supporting colleagues in learning and integrating ChatGPT into shared workflows.\n- **Collaborative problem-solving:** Working with others to co-create prompts, review outputs, and iterate on solutions.\n- **Adapting to new technologies:** Demonstrating openness and adaptability in adopting AI-driven productivity enhancements.\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Implications for Course Design\n\n- **Scaffolded learning:** Begin with foundational tool navigation and prompt basics, progressing to advanced features and integration scenarios.\n- **Hands-on practice:** Emphasize real-world exercises that mirror daily business tasks, ensuring immediate applicability.\n- **Critical reflection:** Incorporate activities that require participants to evaluate and improve ChatGPT outputs, fostering critical thinking.\n- **Collaborative exercises:** Design group tasks to build communication and teamwork skills around AI tool adoption.\n- **Ethics and best practices:** Embed discussions and guidelines on responsible, secure, and ethical use of ChatGPT in business settings.\n\n---\n\nThese competencies form the backbone of a pedagogically sound course structure, ensuring participants not only gain technical proficiency but also develop the evaluative and collaborative skills necessary for sustainable productivity gains with ChatGPT tools.",
