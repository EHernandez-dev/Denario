map each to relevant module(s).\n           - Assign difficulty (Foundational/Intermediate/Advanced) and estimated teaching time (minutes) to each competency.\n           - Summarize constraints/emphases (context/memory depth, Vision and Custom GPT labs, feature-availability decision tree/fallbacks, synthetic datasets/redaction SOP, artifact-based quick checks) and list 3 risk areas (feature unavailability, privacy/PHI, tenant permissions).\n           - Deliverables: core_competencies_matrix.xlsx; constraints_summary.md.\n           - Acceptance check: every competency maps to at least one module and at least one artifact type; total estimated minutes are plausible against 24 hours.\n\n   - Step 2:\n         * sub-task: Make prerequisites actionable and testable with fallbacks\n         * agent: researcher\n         * bullet points:\n           - Create a Pre-course Readiness Checklist with binary Yes/No checks covering accounts, specific feature flags (ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Gen, Custom GPT Builder), browser and file-upload permissions, and hardware/browser norms.\n           - Add stepwise fallback instructions per missing feature (e.g., ADA \u2192 spreadsheet + visual spec; Builder \u2192 simulate with base ChatGPT + files; Vision OCR issues \u2192 crop/re-upload + manual QA).\n           - Specify required sample files with exact filenames and minimal content templates drawn from the idea (e.g., sales_q1_q4.csv, targets.csv, glossary.csv, Product_FAQ.docx, Policy_Guide.pdf, Brand_Guide.pdf) including headers and one illustrative row/page.\n           - Deliverables: pre_course_checklist.pdf; fallback_instructions.md.\n           - Acceptance check: an instructor can run the checklist end-to-end in \u226430 minutes; each missing feature has a clear fallback path.\n\n   - Step 3:\n         * sub-task: Tighten module sequencing, pacing, and alternates; produce timing plan\n         * agent: researcher\n         * bullet points:\n           - Propose the 8-module sequence (3 hours each) matching the syllabus themes and tool coverage; place assessment touchpoints after Modules 2, 4, 5, 7; capstone in Module 8.\n           - For each module, break 180 minutes into segments (lecture/demo, hands-on lab, artifact review/peer QA, buffer/Q&A) and indicate short breaks across the day.\n           - Map module artifacts to be produced (use the explicit filenames from the idea) and link to competencies from Step 1.\n           - Identify conditional paths per module if a feature is unavailable and reference Step 2 fallbacks (e.g., \u201cIf Builder disabled \u2192 follow simulation path A\u201d).\n           - Deliverable: module_timing_plan.csv (module, segment, minutes).\n           - Acceptance check: cumulative minutes across all modules = 24:00;

include expected format.\n           - Provide estimated hands-on minutes per module and 3 instructor lab cues (what to observe, common struggle, success indicator).\n           - Deliverables: modules_learning_goals_and_artifacts.md; artifact_acceptance_criteria.csv.\n           - Acceptance check: every module has at least one measurable artifact and one acceptance criterion; hands-on minutes align with Step 3 timing.\n\n   - Step 5:\n         * sub-task: Strengthen QA with pass/fail rules, accessibility, and feature-failure tests\n         * agent: researcher\n         * bullet points:\n           - Create a QA & Assessment Checklist enumerating checkpoint artifacts (Modules 2, 4, 5, 7) with rubric thresholds (avg \u22653.0, no criterion <2) and remediation paths/timelines (\u22641 week) for reassessment.\n           - Add an accessibility checklist (alt-text, color contrast checks for images, plain language, captioning if any media) and require at least one accessibility test per relevant module.\n           - Produce a Feature-failure test plan with 3 realistic failure scenarios (e.g., Vision OCR fails on skewed image, ADA not available, Browse blocked), each with an instructor fallback script.\n           - Deliverables: qa_checklist.xlsx; accessibility_checks.md; failure_test_plan.md.\n           - Acceptance check: QA checklist includes thresholds, remediation steps, and timeline; accessibility list is applicable to modules with images/docs; at least 3 failure scenarios have actionable scripts.\n\n   - Step 6:\n         * sub-task: Produce the full Course Outline in structured markdown with crosswalks and facilitation notes\n         * agent: researcher\n         * bullet points:\n           - Write the Course Outline in structured markdown including: title, duration, audience, prerequisites/readiness; modules table (title, duration, tools/features, description, key takeaways, SMART learning goals, hands-on minutes); explicit artifact filenames; assessment touchpoints; capstone expectations.\n           - Add a Syllabus CSV crosswalk mapping each module to original idea01_syllabus.csv fields and artifacts for reconciliation by content creators.\n           - Append 1-page Instructor Facilitation Notes per module with 5 cues: start phrase, demo checklist, common pitfall, fallback step, assessment cue.\n           - Deliverables: course_outline.md; syllabus_crosswalk.csv; facilitation_notes.pdf.\n           - Acceptance check: markdown includes all required fields; crosswalk covers all 8 modules and assessment touchpoints; notes reflect alternates and artifacts;
