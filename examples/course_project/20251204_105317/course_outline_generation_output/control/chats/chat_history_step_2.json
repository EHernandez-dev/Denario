Advanced Python knowledge is not required, but familiarity with function definitions and simple modules is essential.\n\n- **Familiarity with Scientific/Numerical Code:**  \n  Some exposure to scientific or numerical computing (e.g., using NumPy, SciPy, or similar libraries) is recommended. Participants should understand the importance of numerical correctness and reproducibility in STEM codebases.\n\n- **Introductory Software Engineering Concepts:**  \n  Awareness of concepts such as code refactoring, code readability, and maintainability. Prior experience with code reviews or legacy code is helpful but not mandatory.\n\n### Required Software and Environment Setup\n\n- **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):**  \n  Participants must have VS Code installed, with the ability to add extensions.\n\n- **Devcontainer Support:**  \n  Either Docker Desktop or a compatible container runtime must be installed to support VS Code devcontainers. This ensures a reproducible, preconfigured environment.\n\n- **Prebuilt Course Repository:**  \n  Access to a provided GitHub repository containing the legacy code snippet, preconfigured devcontainer, and all necessary dependencies (e.g., Poetry, requirements.txt).\n\n- **Python 3.9+ Environment:**  \n  The devcontainer will provide this, but local Python installation is helpful for troubleshooting.\n\n- **Internet Access:**  \n  Required for AI tool integration and package installation.\n\n### Tool Familiarity\n\n- **Copilot Chat for VS Code:**  \n  Participants should have Copilot Chat enabled in VS Code. No prior experience is required, but they should be able to sign in and access the chat interface.\n\n- **ChatGPT (Web or API):**  \n  Access to ChatGPT (free or paid) for contract drafting and prompt experimentation. Familiarity with basic prompt/response workflows is helpful but not required.\n\n- **pytest:**  \n  Basic understanding of running tests with pytest. No advanced test writing experience is necessary; the course will scaffold this skill.\n\n- **mypy and ruff:**  \n  No prior experience required. Participants will be introduced to static type checking (mypy) and linting (ruff) during the course.\n\n### Prior Experience\n\n- **No Advanced AI or DevOps Experience Required:**  \n  The course is designed for mixed-skill STEM professionals. All AI-assisted workflows and DevOps steps (e.g., using devcontainers) will be introduced from first principles.\n\n- **Optional:**  \n  Experience with legacy codebases, code reviews, or scientific computing projects will help participants relate course content to their own work, but is not mandatory.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Requirement                | Mandatory | Notes                                                      |\n|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Python basics              | Yes       | Functions, modules, control flow                           |\n| VS Code                    | Yes       | With extension support                                     |\n| Docker/devcontainer        | Yes       | For reproducible environment                               |\n| Copilot Chat in VS Code    | Yes       | Account setup required                                     |\n| ChatGPT access             | Yes       | Web or API; free tier sufficient                           |\n| pytest familiarity         | Helpful   | Will be taught in course                                   |\n| mypy/ruff familiarity      | No        | Will be taught in course                                   |\n| Scientific code exposure   | Helpful   | Not strictly required                                      |\n| Internet access            | Yes       | For AI tools and package installation                      |\n\n### Prework Checklist for Participants\n\n- Install VS Code and Docker Desktop (or compatible runtime)\n- Clone the course repository and open in VS Code\n- Ensure Copilot Chat extension is installed and signed in\n- Verify access to ChatGPT (web or API)\n- Test that the devcontainer launches and all dependencies install\n- Confirm internet connectivity\n\n### Rationale\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that all participants can fully engage with the hands-on, AI-assisted workflows without being blocked by environment or tool setup.
