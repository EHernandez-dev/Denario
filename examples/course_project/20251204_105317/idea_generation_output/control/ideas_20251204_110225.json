[{"title": "AI-Assisted Legacy Code Deep-Dive: Explain \u2192 Test \u2192 Refactor (Optional Port)", "description": "Designed for STEM professionals to rapidly understand and modernize legacy numerical code by pairing disciplined engineering practices with AI assistants.\nUses VS Code, GitHub Copilot Chat, and ChatGPT with pytest, numpy, mypy, and ruff, following an Explain-Extract-Test-Refactor pipeline anchored by golden-master tests and hallucination guardrails.\nHands-on labs progress from AI-generated summaries and docstrings to characterization tests from curated fixtures, safe refactors under test, and an optional minimal port with parity checks.\nLive coding demos showcase prompt patterns (\u201ccite the line before changing logic,\u201d \u201cgenerate negative cases,\u201d and \u201cinterface-first porting\u201d) and include offline/fallback workflows if AI access is constrained.\nBy day\u2019s end, participants deliver a cleaned, typed module with passing golden-master tests (target 75\u201385% coverage), reduced complexity, and verified numerical equivalence within sensible tolerances (e.g., atol=1e-9), forming a repeatable playbook for real projects."}]
