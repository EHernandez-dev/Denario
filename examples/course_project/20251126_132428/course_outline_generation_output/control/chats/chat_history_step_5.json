The following estimates are based on the complexity of the activity, the expected level of participant interaction, and the pedagogical need for both active engagement and reflective debriefing.\n\n---\n\n## Module 1: Introduction to ChatGPT in Business Contexts\n\n**Exercise:** Icebreaker and group discussion  \n**Duration:** 15 minutes (activity), 5 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nA brief, low-complexity activity to surface participant experiences and set the stage for collaborative learning. The debrief allows for synthesis of shared insights and alignment of expectations.\n\n---\n\n## Module 2: Navigating ChatGPT Advanced Tools\n\n**Exercise:** Guided walkthrough and paired tool exploration  \n**Duration:** 25 minutes (activity), 10 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nParticipants require sufficient time to explore the interface, experiment with uploading data, and use web search features. The paired format encourages peer learning. The debrief consolidates tool proficiency and addresses common challenges.\n\n---\n\n## Module 3: Prompt Engineering for Business Outcomes\n\n**Exercise:** Prompt design workshop with peer feedback  \n**Duration:** 30 minutes (activity), 10 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nPrompt engineering benefits from iterative practice and peer review. The allocated time supports multiple prompt iterations and collaborative critique, with a debrief to highlight best practices and lessons learned.\n\n---\n\n## Module 4: Data-Driven Decision Making with ChatGPT\n\n**Exercise:** Simulation\u2014data analysis and presentation  \n**Duration:** 35 minutes (activity), 10 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nAnalyzing data, generating visualizations, and preparing a brief presentation require extended hands-on time. The simulation format mimics real business tasks, and the debrief ensures that analytical insights are connected to decision-making.\n\n---\n\n## Module 5: Responsible AI Use and Managing Hallucinations\n\n**Exercise:** Role-play scenario\u2014managing AI misinformation and privacy  \n**Duration:** 30 minutes (activity), 10 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nRole-play demands time for scenario immersion, group discussion, and ethical decision-making. The debrief is critical for unpacking ethical frameworks and reinforcing responsible AI practices.\n\n---\n\n## Module 6: Integrating ChatGPT into Business Workflows\n\n**Exercise:** Group simulation\u2014AI integration planning and presentation  \n**Duration:** 40 minutes (activity), 15 minutes (debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nDeveloping and presenting an AI integration plan is a complex, collaborative task. The extended duration allows for team ideation, workflow mapping, and presentation. The debrief supports cross-team learning and addresses implementation challenges.\n\n---\n\n## Module 7: Capstone Simulation and Action Planning\n\n**Exercise:** Capstone simulation and action planning, peer review  \n**Duration:** 45 minutes (activity), 15 minutes (peer review and debrief)  \n**Justification:**  \nThe capstone requires synthesis of all course competencies in a realistic scenario, followed by individualized action planning. Peer review and debriefing are essential for feedback, reflection, and commitment to post-course application.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Module | Exercise Type                | Activity Duration | Debrief/Review Duration | Rationale                                      |\n|--------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Icebreaker & Discussion      | 15 min            | 5 min                  | Low complexity, sets collaborative tone        |\n| 2      | Guided Tool Exploration      | 25 min            | 10 min                 | Tool mastery, peer learning                    |\n| 3      | Prompt Workshop & Feedback   | 30 min            | 10 min                 | Iterative practice, collaborative critique     |\n| 4      | Data Analysis Simulation     | 35 min            | 10 min                 | Realistic analytics, presentation skills       |\n| 5      | Role-Play Scenario           | 30 min            | 10 min                 | Ethical immersion, group reflection            |\n| 6      | Group Integration Simulation | 40 min            | 15 min                 | Complex planning, team presentation            |\n| 7      | Capstone & Action Planning   | 45 min            | 15 min                 | Synthesis, peer review, actionable outcomes    |\n\nThese time allocations are designed to maximize engagement, ensure depth of learning, and provide ample opportunity for reflection and feedback in each hands-on module.",
