Keep all exercises on synthetic/redacted data and reinforce governance at each share-out.\n\n## Module 1 \u2014 LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Mechanics\n- Start phrase: \u201cLet\u2019s standardize on an RTCFCE structure so we can measure changes objectively.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Show swapping ROLE and CONSTRAINTS and observe tone/format changes.\n  - Run vA/vB for the same Context to illustrate evaluation criteria effects.\n  - Contrast free-form vs RTCFCE-structured prompts.\n- Common pitfall: Overstuffing Context or vague Constraints leading to diffuse outputs.\n- Fallback step: If Custom Instructions is unavailable, keep it disabled for parity; rely purely on RTCFCE prompts.\n- Assessment cue: Prompt set includes six prompts, scored vA/vB runs, and a rationale matrix (prompt_set.xlsx).\n\n## Module 2 \u2014 Context Engineering & Memory/Custom Instructions\n- Start phrase: \u201cWe will quantify the impact of Custom Instructions with a CI-on vs CI-off experiment.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Show where to configure Custom Instructions and what fields affect tone vs formatting.\n  - Upload glossary.csv and reference it by exact filename in a prompt.\n  - Walk the decision tree: if Memory disabled, store profile as Knowledge in a Custom GPT.\n- Common pitfall: Expecting CI to override explicit prompt constraints; neglecting filename precision.\n- Fallback step: If Memory disabled or unavailable, create a lightweight Custom GPT with Knowledge containing the profile and glossary; test one task to confirm parity.\n- Assessment cue: CI_template.txt and before_after_log.csv evaluated with the checkpoint rubric.\n\n## Module 3 \u2014 Web-Grounded Research with Browse\n- Start phrase: \u201cResearch is only as credible as the sources we actually opened and verified.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Enable Browse; open and read sources rather than summarizing unseen links.\n  - Use inline bracketed citations and add access dates in references.\n  - Record source metadata in sources.csv with credibility notes.\n- Common pitfall: Citing sources not opened or relying on tertiary aggregators without cross-verification.\n- Fallback step: If Browse is temporarily unstable, model the brief structure and sources.csv schema; complete once Browse resumes or assign vetted seed links.\n- Assessment cue: brief.docx quality hinges on recency, credibility, and consistent inline citations, cross-checked against sources.csv.\n\n## Module 4 \u2014 Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros\n- Start phrase: \u201cTreat ADA as a reproducible analysis environment\u2014inputs, steps, outputs.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Upload sales_q1_q4.csv and targets.csv; preview schema and join keys.\n  - Compute revenue variance and units per product; render a bar chart; export artifacts.\n  - Show how to narrate assumptions and flag outliers.\n- Common pitfall: Misaligned join keys or inconsistent quarter labels; ignoring currency formatting.\n- Fallback step: If ADA is unavailable, request pseudo-calculations and a visual spec; validate in a spreadsheet and export the same artifacts.\n- Assessment cue: kpi_table.csv, chart.png, and summary.txt evaluated at the checkpoint (correctness, clarity, reproducibility).\n\n## Module 5 \u2014 Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)\n- Start phrase: \u201cVision gets you extracted; ADA gets you validated.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Upload policy_handbook.pdf and the skewed table_screenshot.png.\n  - Extract the Coverage limits table to CSV; preserve header names.\n  - Validate totals/ranges in ADA; log OCR issues and corrections in qa_report.txt.\n- Common pitfall: Accepting extraction errors without numeric validation; failing to ask clarifying questions.\n- Fallback step: Crop and re-upload skewed images; if needed, manually correct the CSV and annotate corrections in the QA log.\n- Assessment cue: coverage_limits.csv and qa_report.txt evaluated at the checkpoint (completeness, numeric accuracy, QA transparency).\n\n## Module 6 \u2014 Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows\n- Start phrase: \u201cEvery visual claim must be traceable to a brand rule or accessibility standard.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Parse Brand_Guide.pdf with Vision to extract palette and constraints.\n  - Generate three comps; iteratively refine to two finals aligned to constraints.\n  - Produce contrast ratios, alt-text, and a succinct rationale.\n- Common pitfall: Drifting from brand palette or missing accessibility checks on contrast/alt-text.\n- Fallback step: If Image Generation is degraded, specify imagery as a design brief (prompt text + constraints) and evaluate contrast using palette swatches.\n- Assessment cue: hero_v1.png, hero_v2.png, rationale.txt, and accessibility_checklist.txt reviewed for brand fit and accessibility completeness.\n\n## Module 7 \u2014 Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (simulated)\n- Start phrase: \u201cGuardrails live in the system prompt and the Knowledge discipline.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - In GPT Builder, set a system prompt requiring Knowledge-only citations and explicit \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d behavior.\n  - Upload Product_FAQ.docx, Policy_Guide.pdf, glossary.csv; test five retrievals; log fidelity.\n  - Show the JSON block pattern beneath a human-readable answer and discuss GPT Store listing considerations.\n- Common pitfall: Allowing the model to cite non-Knowledge content or omitting page/line granularity where available.\n- Fallback step: If Builder is disabled, simulate in a standard ChatGPT chat by uploading files and enforcing constraints in the prompt; still produce test_log.csv and a mock store listing.\n- Assessment cue: working Custom GPT or simulated equivalent plus test_log.csv and store_listing.txt reviewed at the checkpoint.\n\n## Module 8 \u2014 Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n- Start phrase: \u201cWorkflow value only lands when governance and reproducibility are explicit.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Review Teams/Enterprise settings: data controls, retention, workspace sharing.\n  - Ensure capstone uses synthetic/redacted data; record any fallbacks used.\n  - Produce SOP with steps, tools, risks, privacy controls, RACI, and acceptance criteria.\n- Common pitfall: Missing privacy controls, unclear acceptance criteria, or insufficient tool integration.\n- Fallback step: If any feature is blocked, incorporate the documented fallback path and annotate it in the SOP and governance checklist.\n- Assessment cue: capstone_pack.zip assessed against capstone rubric (completeness, integration, evidence grounding, governance, business relevance).\n\n\n\n# Further Resources (for organizers)\n- OpenAI Help Center (Teams/Enterprise, ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom GPTs, GPT Store): https://help.openai.com\n- OpenAI Policies (privacy, data usage, safety): https://openai.com/policies\n- OpenAI Cookbook (prompting patterns, data workflows): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\n- WCAG 2.1 (contrast and alt-text standards): https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n\n# Further Resources (for participants)\n- Getting started with Browse, ADA, and Vision in ChatGPT: https://help.openai.com\n- Prompt engineering basics (OpenAI Cookbook): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- Responsible use of generative AI in the workplace (OpenAI policies): https://openai.com/policies\n- W3C WAI tutorials (contrast and alt-text): https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n- Purdue OWL (research and citation primer): https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/overview.html\n\nNotes:\n- All modules require synthetic/redacted data.\n- Feature-availability decision tree with fallbacks is mandatory;

Keep all exercises on synthetic/redacted data and reinforce governance at each share-out.\n\n## Module 1 \u2014 LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Mechanics\n- Start phrase: \u201cLet\u2019s standardize on an RTCFCE structure so we can measure changes objectively.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Show swapping ROLE and CONSTRAINTS and observe tone/format changes.\n  - Run vA/vB for the same Context to illustrate evaluation criteria effects.\n  - Contrast free-form vs RTCFCE-structured prompts.\n- Common pitfall: Overstuffing Context or vague Constraints leading to diffuse outputs.\n- Fallback step: If Custom Instructions is unavailable, keep it disabled for parity; rely purely on RTCFCE prompts.\n- Assessment cue: Prompt set includes six prompts, scored vA/vB runs, and a rationale matrix (prompt_set.xlsx).\n\n## Module 2 \u2014 Context Engineering & Memory/Custom Instructions\n- Start phrase: \u201cWe will quantify the impact of Custom Instructions with a CI-on vs CI-off experiment.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Show where to configure Custom Instructions and what fields affect tone vs formatting.\n  - Upload glossary.csv and reference it by exact filename in a prompt.\n  - Walk the decision tree: if Memory disabled, store profile as Knowledge in a Custom GPT.\n- Common pitfall: Expecting CI to override explicit prompt constraints; neglecting filename precision.\n- Fallback step: If Memory disabled or unavailable, create a lightweight Custom GPT with Knowledge containing the profile and glossary; test one task to confirm parity.\n- Assessment cue: CI_template.txt and before_after_log.csv evaluated with the checkpoint rubric.\n\n## Module 3 \u2014 Web-Grounded Research with Browse\n- Start phrase: \u201cResearch is only as credible as the sources we actually opened and verified.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Enable Browse; open and read sources rather than summarizing unseen links.\n  - Use inline bracketed citations and add access dates in references.\n  - Record source metadata in sources.csv with credibility notes.\n- Common pitfall: Citing sources not opened or relying on tertiary aggregators without cross-verification.\n- Fallback step: If Browse is temporarily unstable, model the brief structure and sources.csv schema; complete once Browse resumes or assign vetted seed links.\n- Assessment cue: brief.docx quality hinges on recency, credibility, and consistent inline citations, cross-checked against sources.csv.\n\n## Module 4 \u2014 Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros\n- Start phrase: \u201cTreat ADA as a reproducible analysis environment\u2014inputs, steps, outputs.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Upload sales_q1_q4.csv and targets.csv; preview schema and join keys.\n  - Compute revenue variance and units per product; render a bar chart; export artifacts.\n  - Show how to narrate assumptions and flag outliers.\n- Common pitfall: Misaligned join keys or inconsistent quarter labels; ignoring currency formatting.\n- Fallback step: If ADA is unavailable, request pseudo-calculations and a visual spec; validate in a spreadsheet and export the same artifacts.\n- Assessment cue: kpi_table.csv, chart.png, and summary.txt evaluated at the checkpoint (correctness, clarity, reproducibility).\n\n## Module 5 \u2014 Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)\n- Start phrase: \u201cVision gets you extracted; ADA gets you validated.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Upload policy_handbook.pdf and the skewed table_screenshot.png.\n  - Extract the Coverage limits table to CSV; preserve header names.\n  - Validate totals/ranges in ADA; log OCR issues and corrections in qa_report.txt.\n- Common pitfall: Accepting extraction errors without numeric validation; failing to ask clarifying questions.\n- Fallback step: Crop and re-upload skewed images; if needed, manually correct the CSV and annotate corrections in the QA log.\n- Assessment cue: coverage_limits.csv and qa_report.txt evaluated at the checkpoint (completeness, numeric accuracy, QA transparency).\n\n## Module 6 \u2014 Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows\n- Start phrase: \u201cEvery visual claim must be traceable to a brand rule or accessibility standard.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Parse Brand_Guide.pdf with Vision to extract palette and constraints.\n  - Generate three comps; iteratively refine to two finals aligned to constraints.\n  - Produce contrast ratios, alt-text, and a succinct rationale.\n- Common pitfall: Drifting from brand palette or missing accessibility checks on contrast/alt-text.\n- Fallback step: If Image Generation is degraded, specify imagery as a design brief (prompt text + constraints) and evaluate contrast using palette swatches.\n- Assessment cue: hero_v1.png, hero_v2.png, rationale.txt, and accessibility_checklist.txt reviewed for brand fit and accessibility completeness.\n\n## Module 7 \u2014 Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (simulated)\n- Start phrase: \u201cGuardrails live in the system prompt and the Knowledge discipline.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - In GPT Builder, set a system prompt requiring Knowledge-only citations and explicit \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d behavior.\n  - Upload Product_FAQ.docx, Policy_Guide.pdf, glossary.csv; test five retrievals; log fidelity.\n  - Show the JSON block pattern beneath a human-readable answer and discuss GPT Store listing considerations.\n- Common pitfall: Allowing the model to cite non-Knowledge content or omitting page/line granularity where available.\n- Fallback step: If Builder is disabled, simulate in a standard ChatGPT chat by uploading files and enforcing constraints in the prompt; still produce test_log.csv and a mock store listing.\n- Assessment cue: working Custom GPT or simulated equivalent plus test_log.csv and store_listing.txt reviewed at the checkpoint.\n\n## Module 8 \u2014 Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n- Start phrase: \u201cWorkflow value only lands when governance and reproducibility are explicit.\u201d\n- Demo checklist:\n  - Review Teams/Enterprise settings: data controls, retention, workspace sharing.\n  - Ensure capstone uses synthetic/redacted data; record any fallbacks used.\n  - Produce SOP with steps, tools, risks, privacy controls, RACI, and acceptance criteria.\n- Common pitfall: Missing privacy controls, unclear acceptance criteria, or insufficient tool integration.\n- Fallback step: If any feature is blocked, incorporate the documented fallback path and annotate it in the SOP and governance checklist.\n- Assessment cue: capstone_pack.zip assessed against capstone rubric (completeness, integration, evidence grounding, governance, business relevance).\n\n\n\n# Further Resources (for organizers)\n- OpenAI Help Center (Teams/Enterprise, ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom GPTs, GPT Store): https://help.openai.com\n- OpenAI Policies (privacy, data usage, safety): https://openai.com/policies\n- OpenAI Cookbook (prompting patterns, data workflows): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\n- WCAG 2.1 (contrast and alt-text standards): https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n\n# Further Resources (for participants)\n- Getting started with Browse, ADA, and Vision in ChatGPT: https://help.openai.com\n- Prompt engineering basics (OpenAI Cookbook): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- Responsible use of generative AI in the workplace (OpenAI policies): https://openai.com/policies\n- W3C WAI tutorials (contrast and alt-text): https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n- Purdue OWL (research and citation primer): https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/overview.html\n\nNotes:\n- All modules require synthetic/redacted data.\n- Feature-availability decision tree with fallbacks is mandatory;

Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n### Description:\nOperationalizes privacy, data controls, and workspace configurations; then executes an end-to-end capstone integrating at least three tools (e.g., Vision + ADA + Browse) on synthetic/redacted data. Participants deliver an SOP, governance checklist, RACI, and measurable acceptance criteria ready for enterprise review.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A governance-compliant, SOP-backed workflow for team adoption.\n- RACI and acceptance criteria enabling replication and sign-off.\n- A privacy-by-design stance for ongoing enterprise use.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants review Teams/Enterprise settings (data controls, retention, workspace sharing) and document selections in the SOP within capstone_pack.zip.\n- Participants execute a cross-tool workflow (\u22653 tools) and include all artifacts and a governance checklist in capstone_pack.zip.\n- Participants include a RACI table and measurable acceptance criteria in capstone_pack.zip; all fallbacks used are documented.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 110 minutes, Debrief: 30 minutes\n\n\n\n### Assessment Touchpoints and Capstone Expectations\n- Practical checkpoints after Modules 2, 4, 5, and 7 using rubric criteria (scale 1\u20134): Correctness; Clarity/Structure; Grounding/Citations (if relevant); Reproducibility; Compliance (privacy/brand). Passing requires average \u22653.0 with no criterion <2.0.\n- Capstone rubric (Module 8): End-to-end completeness; Tool integration (\u22653 tools); Evidence grounding; Governance/SOP quality; Business relevance. Passing requires average \u22653.0 and Governance \u22653.0.\n- Feature-availability decision tree and fallbacks apply throughout (e.g., Knowledge-as-profile if Memory disabled; spreadsheet pseudo-calculations + visual spec if ADA unavailable; base ChatGPT + file uploads if Builder disabled; crop/re-upload/manual correction for Vision OCR issues). All fallbacks must be documented in artifacts and the capstone SOP.\n\n---\n\nFurther resources for organizers:\n- OpenAI Help Center (Teams/Enterprise, ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom GPTs, GPT Store): https://help.openai.com\n- OpenAI Policies (privacy, data usage, safety): https://openai.com/policies\n- OpenAI Cookbook (prompting patterns, data workflows): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\n- WCAG 2.1 (contrast and alt-text standards): https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n\nFurther resources for participants:\n- Getting started with Browse, ADA, and Vision in ChatGPT: https://help.openai.com\n- Prompt engineering basics (OpenAI Cookbook): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- Responsible use of generative AI in the workplace (OpenAI policies): https://openai.com/policies\n- W3C WAI tutorials (contrast and alt-text): https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n- Purdue OWL (research and citation primer): https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/overview.html",

Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros\n### Description:\nApplies ADA to analyze multi-file CSVs (join, compute KPIs, visualize) and communicates assumptions and outliers concisely. Where ADA is unavailable, a spreadsheet fallback (pseudo-calculations + visual specification) preserves rigor and reproducibility.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A reproducible join\u2013transform\u2013visualize pipeline.\n- Portable KPI tables and charts for stakeholders.\n- An assumption-transparent narrative with outlier detection.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants join sales_q1_q4.csv with targets.csv on quarter and export kpi_table.csv with revenue variance and units per product.\n- Participants generate and export a KPI bar chart (chart.png) with correct labels and currency formatting.\n- Participants author a maximum 150-word summary stating assumptions and flagging outliers (>2 SD), saved as summary.txt.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n\n\n## 5. Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)\n### Description:\nUses Vision to locate, extract, and normalize tables from PDFs and images; validates numeric integrity with ADA. Emphasizes OCR/structure error handling, clarifying questions, and cropping/re-upload for skewed images, culminating in a five-check QA report.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A reliable Vision extraction and normalization workflow.\n- Numeric validation and reconciliation via ADA.\n- Transparent QA and error logging suitable for audit.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants extract the \u201cCoverage limits\u201d table from policy_handbook.pdf and table_screenshot.png and export coverage_limits.csv preserving header names.\n- Participants validate totals/ranges with ADA and record issues, corrections, and decisions in qa_report.txt (\u22655 checks).\n- Participants apply cropping/re-upload when OCR fidelity is low and document interventions in qa_report.txt.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n\n\n## 6. Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows\n### Description:\nCombines Vision-based brand parsing with Image Generation to produce on-brief assets that satisfy brand and accessibility constraints. Participants generate three comps, refine to two finals, verify color contrast ratios, write alt-text, and justify choices via a concise rationale.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A lightweight brand-to-asset pipeline (Vision + Image Generation).\n- Accessibility-first checks (contrast ratios, alt-text) embedded in review.\n- Rationale discipline linking visuals to brand rules.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants parse Brand_Guide.pdf with Vision to extract palette and constraints and reflect them in two final images (hero_v1.png; hero_v2.png).\n- Participants compile accessibility_checklist.txt including color contrast notes and alt-text per image.\n- Participants produce a 120-word rationale linking design decisions to brand constraints, saved as rationale.txt.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 90 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n\n\n## 7. Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (simulated)\n### Description:\nBuilds a task-specific assistant using Custom GPT Builder with a precise RTCFCE system prompt and Knowledge files. Enforces Knowledge-only citations, tests retrieval fidelity, and simulates a no-code Action via a structured JSON output for downstream tools. Includes GPT Store listing considerations and a base ChatGPT simulation path if Builder is unavailable.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A working Custom GPT scaffold with guardrails and Knowledge-only citations.\n- A retrieval QA/testing log with confidence reporting.\n- A parseable JSON output pattern enabling automation.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants create \u201cTeam FAQ Assistant\u201d as an unlisted Custom GPT with system prompt requiring Knowledge-only citations and explicit \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d behavior when content is absent.\n- Participants upload Product_FAQ.docx, Policy_Guide.pdf, and glossary.csv; test at least five questions; log retrieval fidelity and citation integrity in test_log.csv.\n- Participants produce a human-readable answer plus a JSON block {answer, citations, confidence} and author a mock GPT Store listing saved as store_listing.txt.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 100 minutes, Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n\n\n## 8. Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n### Description:\nOperationalizes privacy, data controls, and workspace configurations; then executes an end-to-end capstone integrating at least three tools (e.g., Vision + ADA + Browse) on synthetic/redacted data. Participants deliver an SOP, governance checklist, RACI, and measurable acceptance criteria ready for enterprise review.\n\n### Takeaways:\n- A governance-compliant, SOP-backed workflow for team adoption.\n- RACI and acceptance criteria enabling replication and sign-off.\n- A privacy-by-design stance for ongoing enterprise use.\n\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants review Teams/Enterprise settings (data controls, retention, workspace sharing) and document selections in the SOP within capstone_pack.zip.\n- Participants execute a cross-tool workflow (\u22653 tools) and include all artifacts and a governance checklist in capstone_pack.zip.\n- Participants include a RACI table and measurable acceptance criteria in capstone_pack.zip; all fallbacks used are documented.\n\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 110 minutes, Debrief: 30 minutes\n\n\n\n### Assessment Touchpoints and Capstone Expectations\n- Practical checkpoints after Modules 2, 4, 5, and 7 using rubric criteria (scale 1\u20134): Correctness; Clarity/Structure; Grounding/Citations (if relevant); Reproducibility; Compliance (privacy/brand). Passing requires average \u22653.0 with no criterion <2.0.\n- Capstone rubric (Module 8): End-to-end completeness; Tool integration (\u22653 tools); Evidence grounding; Governance/SOP quality; Business relevance. Passing requires average \u22653.0 and Governance \u22653.0.\n- Feature-availability decision tree and fallbacks apply throughout (e.g., Knowledge-as-profile if Memory disabled; spreadsheet pseudo-calculations + visual spec if ADA unavailable; base ChatGPT + file uploads if Builder disabled; crop/re-upload/manual correction for Vision OCR issues). All fallbacks must be documented in artifacts and the capstone SOP.\n\n---\n\nFurther resources for organizers:\n- OpenAI Help Center (Teams/Enterprise, ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom GPTs, GPT Store): https://help.openai.com\n- OpenAI Policies (privacy, data usage, safety): https://openai.com/policies\n- OpenAI Cookbook (prompting patterns, data workflows): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\n- WCAG 2.1 (contrast and alt-text standards): https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n\nFurther resources for participants:\n- Getting started with Browse, ADA, and Vision in ChatGPT: https://help.openai.com\n- Prompt engineering basics (OpenAI Cookbook): https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook\n- Responsible use of generative AI in the workplace (OpenAI policies): https://openai.com/policies\n- W3C WAI tutorials (contrast and alt-text): https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n- Purdue OWL (research and citation primer): https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/overview.html\n```",
