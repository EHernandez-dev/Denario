ensure no blueprint exceeds one page.\n\n- Improve Step 4 (Governance, QA, assessment) by making QA metrics and audit mechanisms concrete.\n    - For each QA/gov item, require measurable pass/fail rules (e.g., retrieval QA: \u226595% grounded answers in a 10-question suite with \u226580% correct-with-citation; abstention rate \u2264 Z for OOD prompts).\n    - Specify how audit trails are captured: versioned filenames, automatic test_log.csv entries, timestamp conventions, and where logs are stored (path templates).\n    - Add an explicit privacy/PII handling checklist and a short risk-rating rubric (Low/Medium/High) applied to example document types.\n    - Instructions for the researcher: produce governance_checklist.md with pass/fail rules, an \"audit-trail-template.csv\", and a short example showing how a module exercise meets the rule.\n\n- Tighten Step 5 (Finalize structure, dependencies, artifact naming) with dependency graphs and contingency plans.\n    - Require a simple dependency map (edges: module -> module) in machine-readable form (e.g., dependencies.json) so scheduling and sequencing are unambiguous.\n    - Provide a contingency checklist for common failures (e.g., API rate limits, OCR failure, account permission issues) with immediate mitigations and time costs.\n    - Standardize artifact naming and storage conventions with examples (e.g., idea03_M3_normalized_v1.csv;
