# Proposed Module Sequence: ChatGPT Pro Power User – No-Code Productivity and Analysis

The following module sequence is designed to scaffold learning from foundational prompt engineering to advanced, multi-tool workflows and governance. Each module builds on the skills and concepts introduced in previous sessions, ensuring a logical progression and comprehensive coverage of all major tools and features.

---

## 1. LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Mechanics
**Focus:**  
Establishes foundational understanding of large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering using the RTCFCE framework. Participants learn to craft, test, and evaluate prompts for clarity, accuracy, and constraint adherence.

**Progression:**  
Serves as the entry point, ensuring all participants have a shared vocabulary and baseline skills for interacting with ChatGPT.

---

## 2. Context Engineering & Memory/Custom Instructions
**Focus:**  
Explores strategies for providing context to ChatGPT, including the use of Custom Instructions and Memory. Participants learn to personalize outputs, manage domain-specific glossaries, and apply privacy best practices.

**Progression:**  
Builds on prompt mechanics by introducing persistent context and user-specific customization, setting the stage for more complex, context-aware workflows.

---

## 3. Web-Grounded Research with Browse
**Focus:**  
Introduces the Browse feature for real-time web research. Participants practice sourcing, evaluating, and citing up-to-date information, emphasizing credibility and recency.

**Progression:**  
Extends context engineering to external data sources, reinforcing prompt and context skills in a research setting.

---

## 4. Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros
**Focus:**  
Covers Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) capabilities, including multi-file uploads, KPI computation, and data visualization. Participants analyze synthetic datasets and narrate findings.

**Progression:**  
Transitions from text-based tasks to structured data analysis, integrating file handling and quantitative reasoning.

---

## 5. Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)
**Focus:**  
Utilizes Vision features to extract structured data from PDFs and images, correct OCR errors, and validate outputs. Emphasizes document processing and quality assurance.

**Progression:**  
Builds on ADA by introducing unstructured data sources and multimodal analysis, increasing task complexity.

---

## 6. Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows
**Focus:**  
Introduces image generation and multimodal workflows, integrating brand guidelines and accessibility requirements. Participants create, refine, and assess images for business use.

**Progression:**  
Expands multimodal capabilities, requiring synthesis of text, image, and brand constraints.

---

## 7. Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (Simulated)
**Focus:**  
Guides participants through designing and testing Custom GPTs using Builder, Knowledge files, and simulated no-code Actions. Covers system prompt engineering, retrieval quality, and store listing preparation.

**Progression:**  
Moves from using built-in features to creating custom, reusable AI tools, emphasizing modularity and deployment.

---

## 8. Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone
**Focus:**  
Addresses governance, privacy, and compliance in Teams/Enterprise environments. Participants execute a capstone workflow, integrating multiple tools and producing SOPs and governance checklists.

**Progression:**  
Culminates in an end-to-end, real-world workflow that synthesizes all prior skills, with a strong focus on compliance and operationalization.

---

**Progression Summary:**  
The course begins with foundational prompt and context skills, then incrementally introduces external data, structured analysis, multimodal processing, and custom tool creation. It concludes with governance and a capstone project, ensuring participants can confidently deploy no-code AI solutions in professional settings.

**Coverage of Tools and Features:**  
- Prompting frameworks, Custom Instructions/Memory (Modules 1–2)
- Browse (Module 3)
- Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), multi-file uploads (Module 4)
- Vision (PDF/image analysis), ADA validation (Module 5)
- Image Generation, Vision (Module 6)
- Custom GPT Builder, Knowledge files, simulated Actions, GPT Store (Module 7)
- Teams/Enterprise features, privacy, governance (Module 8)

This sequence ensures a logical, scaffolded progression from foundational to advanced competencies, with explicit tool coverage and increasing complexity at each stage.
