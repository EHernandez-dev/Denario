    "content": "Recommendations:\n\n- Reassign a technical stress-test step to the engineer (modify Step 4): change the agent in charge of Step 4 from idea_hater to engineer and rewrite the step instructions so the engineer performs an empirical, technical feasibility analysis. Required outputs: a tool-availability matrix (Plus vs Teams/Enterprise feature support), a module-by-module resource/time-cost spreadsheet, a privacy/compliance flag per tool, and a package of sample lab assets (sample CSVs/PDFs/images, DALL\u00b7E prompt pack, Custom GPT manifest templates, and a \u201cno\u2011code connector\u201d example). Acceptance criteria: matrix completed, at least one sample asset per lab, and clear \u201cmust-have vs nice-to-have\u201d access levels.\n\n- Strengthen Step 1 deliverables (idea_maker): require each of the five ideas to include (a) explicit module-level time estimates (hours per module and hands-on lab time) so the 24-hour scope is verifiable, (b) a \u201clab requirements\u201d list specifying exact sample files and access level (Free/Plus/Enterprise), (c) one concrete capstone concept with success criteria, and (d) an initial set of 3 exemplar prompts or template outputs for a non-coder. Deliverables: ideas.md and lab-needs.csv.\n\n- Make Step 2 (idea_hater) produce structured, machine-readable critiques: in addition to narrative pros/cons, require a scored rubric (CSV) with columns for pedagogical soundness, feasibility (time), industry fit, technical depth, hands-on adequacy, and privacy risk. Require concrete remediation suggestions per idea (one-sentence prioritized fixes) and highlight any developer-only content that must be made non-technical. Deliverables: critique.csv and critique-memo.pdf.\n\n- Clarify Step 3 outputs and handoff to engineer (idea_maker): when selecting the top 2 ideas, idea_maker must (a) attach a short justification linking critique scores to selection, (b) produce revised module outlines with explicit tool coverage (ADA, Browsing, Vision, DALL\u00b7E, Custom GPTs, Memory, structured outputs) and per-module learning outcomes, (c) create capstone rubrics (JSON) with pass/fail benchmarks, and (d) produce a precise \u201cassets request\u201d list for the engineer (filenames, formats, sizes). Deliverables: improved_ideas.md, capstone_rubrics.json, assets_request.csv.\n\n- Reintroduce idea_hater for a final pedagogical critique after engineer work (modify Step 5 flow): keep Step 5 as idea_maker\u2019s selection task but require a mandatory signoff loop \u2014 the engineer\u2019s feasibility outputs (Step 4) and idea_hater\u2019s structured critiques (Step 2) must be reviewed together. Require idea_maker to produce selection_rationale.md mapping technical depth and feasibility to the final choice; require idea_hater to give a final quick sanity-check (one-paragraph acceptance or two required changes) before Step 6 proceeds.\n\n- Tighten Step 6 (idea_maker) deliverables: the final title + five-sentence description must also include (a) three concrete learning outcomes phrased as \u201cBy the end of this course you will be able to\u2026\u201d, (b) a one-paragraph instructor notes section listing prerequisites and required account types, and (c) one sample module schedule showing pacing across 24 hours. Deliverables: course_title.txt, description_and_outcomes.pdf, schedule.xlsx.\n\n- Keep Step 7 with the researcher but expand the researcher\u2019s brief (modify Step 7 instructions): researcher produces the deliberation report integrating all artifacts (ideas.md, critique.csv, improved_ideas.md, engineer\u2019s feasibility appendix, final selection rationale). Require the report to contain (a) an executive summary, (b) a decision trace showing why 3 ideas were deprioritized, (c) a concatenated appendix with all machine-readable artifacts, and (d) a short, actionable checklist for converting the winning idea into a deliverable 24-hour syllabus. Deliverables: deliberation_report.pdf and appendices.zip.\n\n- Require explicit filenames, formats, and single-source-of-truth handoffs between steps: after each step the responsible agent must drop their outputs into a named folder (e.g., /deliverables/step01_ideas.md) and list the exact files they provided. The next-step agent must confirm receipt and accept or request one round of revisions within a defined SLA (e.g., 48 hours). This prevents ambiguity and ensures traceability.\n\n- Add measurable acceptance criteria and minimal QA for each step (per-step change): for every sub-task add 3 short acceptance checks the agent must satisfy (e.g., \u201cincludes time per module; shows lab assets list; specifies access level\u201d). Put those checks in the step instructions so reviewers can quickly verify readiness to proceed.\n\n- Provide one non-redundant time-budget line per step (do not add steps): attach to each step a recommended time budget for creating the deliverable (e.g., Step 1: 6 hours to produce 5 ideas with lab lists; Step 2: 3 hours for structured critique; Step 3: 4 hours to revise top 2 ideas; Step 4: 4 hours engineer feasibility; Step 5: 1.5 hours final selection; Step 6: 1 hour title/description; Step 7: 4.5 hours research report). These numbers ensure the overall work is realistic and keep the course\u2019s 24-hour scope visible.\n\nEach of these recommendations is a concrete modification to the existing plan: they assign the engineer a clear technical-stress-testing role, tighten outputs and handoffs for every agent, add machine-readable artifacts, define acceptance criteria, and add time budgets \u2014 all without increasing the number of steps or repeating instructions. Implementing them will better distribute responsibilities according to each agent\u2019s strengths and produce verifiable deliverables at every handoff.",
