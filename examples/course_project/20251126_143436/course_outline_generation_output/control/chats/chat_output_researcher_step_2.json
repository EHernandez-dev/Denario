The curriculum assumes no prior experience with artificial intelligence, programming, or data science. However, participants are expected to possess foundational business knowledge and a willingness to engage with new digital tools in a professional context.\n\n### Detailed Prerequisites\n\n#### 1. General Business Acumen\n- **Requirement:** Familiarity with basic business operations, terminology, and workflows.\n- **Rationale:** Participants should be able to contextualize AI applications within their own business environments, such as marketing, sales, customer service, or project management.\n\n#### 2. Digital Literacy\n- **Requirement:** Comfort with standard office productivity tools (e.g., email, word processing, spreadsheets) and web-based applications.\n- **Rationale:** The course involves hands-on exercises using ChatGPT interfaces and may require navigating online platforms or copying/pasting data.\n\n#### 3. Problem-Solving Mindset\n- **Requirement:** Ability to identify and articulate business challenges or inefficiencies.\n- **Rationale:** Participants will be expected to map real-world business problems to potential AI-driven solutions and evaluate the impact of those solutions.\n\n#### 4. Communication Skills\n- **Requirement:** Proficiency in written and verbal business communication.\n- **Rationale:** Effective prompt engineering and evaluation of AI outputs depend on clear, concise communication and critical review.\n\n#### 5. No Prior AI or Programming Experience Required\n- **Clarification:** The course is explicitly designed for those without a technical background. All AI concepts, terminology, and tools will be introduced from first principles.\n\n### Recommended (But Not Required) Experience\n\n- **Exposure to Business Process Improvement:** Experience with initiatives such as Lean, Six Sigma, or digital transformation may enhance participants\u2019 ability to identify high-impact AI use cases.\n- **Interest in Innovation or Change Management:** A proactive attitude toward adopting new technologies will facilitate deeper engagement with course content.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Prerequisite Area         | Required Level                | Notes                                                      |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business Knowledge       | Basic understanding           | E.g., roles, processes, and objectives in own organization |\n| Digital Literacy         | Comfortable with web tools     | No coding or advanced IT skills needed                     |\n| Problem-Solving          | Able to identify challenges    | Will apply to real or hypothetical business scenarios      |\n| Communication            | Proficient in business English | For prompt writing and output evaluation                   |\n| AI/Programming           | None required                  | All concepts introduced in course                          |\n\n### Alignment with Course Expectations\n\nThese prerequisites ensure that participants can fully engage with the course\u2019s practical, business-focused approach to AI. The course will scaffold all technical concepts, focusing on actionable skills and real-world application rather than theoretical or technical depth. This alignment maximizes accessibility while ensuring that learning outcomes are relevant and immediately applicable in a business context.",
