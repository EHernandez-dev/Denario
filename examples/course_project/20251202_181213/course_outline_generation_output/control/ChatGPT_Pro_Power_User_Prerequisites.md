## Prerequisites and Foundational Knowledge for "ChatGPT Pro Power User: No-Code Productivity and Analysis"

### 1. Prior Knowledge and Skills

- **No coding or technical background is required.** The course is designed for cross-functional professionals, including those in operations, finance, research, and creative roles.
- **Basic digital literacy:** Participants should be comfortable navigating web applications, uploading/downloading files, and using productivity tools (e.g., spreadsheets, word processors).
- **Familiarity with business workflows:** While not mandatory, experience with business documentation, data analysis, or research tasks will help contextualize exercises.

### 2. Required Accounts and Access

- **ChatGPT Plus or Teams/Enterprise Account:**  
  - Participants must have an active subscription to ChatGPT Plus or access to a Teams/Enterprise tenant.
  - The account must support the following features:
    - Advanced Data Analysis (ADA)
    - Browse (web browsing)
    - Vision (image/PDF analysis)
    - Image Generation
    - File Uploads (multi-file support)
    - Custom Instructions/Memory
    - Custom GPT Builder (for modules on Custom GPTs)
    - GPT Store access (for simulated publishing)
    - Teams/Enterprise workspace features (for governance module)
- **Instructor Demo Tenant:**  
  - If participants lack access to certain features (e.g., Custom GPT Builder), the instructor should provide a demo environment or facilitate group walkthroughs.

### 3. Technical Setup

- **Hardware:**
  - Modern computer with a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari)
  - Minimum 8 GB RAM recommended for smooth file handling and multitasking
  - Headset or speakers for live sessions and discussions

- **Software:**
  - Up-to-date web browser
  - Ability to open and edit CSV, DOCX, and PDF files (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Docs/Sheets, or free alternatives)
  - Optional: basic image viewer/editor for reviewing generated images

- **Network:**
  - Reliable internet connection capable of supporting web-based AI tools and file uploads/downloads

### 4. Feature Availability and Fallbacks

- **Feature Verification:**  
  - Before the course, participants must verify that all required ChatGPT features are enabled in their account/tenant.
  - A pre-course checklist will be provided to confirm access to ADA, Browse, Vision, Image Generation, Custom Instructions, Custom GPT Builder, and Teams/Enterprise features.

- **Fallback Options:**  
  - If a feature is unavailable (e.g., Custom GPT Builder, ADA), participants will:
    - Use simulated workflows (e.g., manual prompt engineering in base ChatGPT for Custom GPTs)
    - Follow instructor-led demonstrations
    - Apply alternative tools (e.g., spreadsheet software for data analysis if ADA is not available)
    - Reference provided decision trees for feature-specific fallbacks

### 5. Data and Privacy Requirements

- **Synthetic Dataset Pack:**  
  - All exercises use provided synthetic or redacted datasets (CSV, PDF, DOCX, PNG) to avoid handling confidential or personally identifiable information (PII/PHI).
  - Participants must not upload any real or sensitive business data.

- **Privacy and Compliance:**  
  - Participants should be aware of their organization’s data privacy policies.
  - The course enforces a "no PHI/PII" policy and includes explicit governance and compliance checkpoints.

### 6. Time Commitment

- **Contact Hours:**  
  - 24 hours of structured instruction and hands-on labs
- **Optional Practice:**  
  - Up to 2 additional hours for self-paced practice or review
