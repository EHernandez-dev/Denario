## Denario
This is basically a multiagent system, where the most complete and costly implementation uses CMBAgent and for faster but worse performance they use LangGraph.
It is basically a wrapper with some smart prompt engineering.

To create the app they used streamlit.
To make it track the changes in files fast and and efficienty they use watchdog.

### Ideas

Is it possible to modify this to create courses for the TransferLab instead of papers?
It would be a good add on to have the GUI for the Academy Team.
It would also be interesting to benchmark the course making against a course we have already created in quality and time spent making it.
-> We could then ask ourselves how much does this speed our productivity
