Test quality: golden-master tests pass; line coverage 75\u201385%; \u226510 edge cases captured; flakiness <1% with seeded RNG. Code quality: mypy clean (0 errors); ruff clean (0 violations); cyclomatic complexity reduced by 20\u201340%; function length reduced by 15\u201330% without behavior change. Correctness: parity vs reference within atol=1e-9; covariance PSD check passes on all fixtures. Productivity: time-to-understand (measured by task completion of a comprehension quiz) reduced by ~40\u201360% compared to baseline; AI assist acceptance rate \u226550% with post-edit deltas tracked.\n\t\t- Verdict: Selected. It maximizes likelihood of success in one day, targets a ubiquitous STEM need, and offers clear, verifiable gains in maintainability, correctness, and comprehension with quantifiable metrics (coverage, complexity reduction, parity tolerances, and time-to-understand improvements).\n\n        ",
