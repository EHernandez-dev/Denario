submit rubric scores plus a 2\u20133 sentence justification per criterion.\n\nStep 2 (fail-thresholds and prescriptive improvements): require idea_hater to mark any idea failing minimum threshold (e.g., average score < 3.0) and recommend drop or radical revision, and provide 2\u20134 concrete prescriptive improvements per idea (e.g., replace generic demo with a specific lab, reallocate minutes between modules).\n\nStep 2 (risk-flagging): require idea_hater to flag obsolete/risky feature assumptions (Teams/Enterprise, privacy-sensitive data) and recommend exact contemporary alternatives or operational constraints.\n\nStep 3 (apply critiques; top-two deliverables): require idea_maker to select the top two rubric-ranked ideas and deliver revised 24-hour syllabi with module-level learning objectives mapped to assessment artifacts; full lab plans for each module (step-by-step no-code flows, required sample files, instructor notes, expected artifacts); a complete assessment plan (rubrics for practical checkpoints and capstone with pass/fail criteria); and an annotated changelog listing each Step 2 critique and how it was addressed.\n\nStep 3 (prompts, versions, and validation): require concrete prompt/workflow templates per module following ROLE\u2013TASK\u2013CONTEXT\u2013FORMAT\u2013CONSTRAINTS\u2013EVALUATION, at least two prompt-versioning examples for A/B evaluation, a short pre-course learner checklist, and one-click shareable sample dataset/knowledge file links or instructions to create them so reviewers can validate labs without further requests.\n\nStep 4 (timeline simulation and rebalancing): require idea_hater to run a timeline simulation for each revised idea (mock-teach the 24-hour schedule), identify overloaded modules (needing > allocated time) and thin labs (insufficient steps to reach objectives) and propose specific rebalancing actions for each problem.\n\nStep 4 (governance/privacy audit): require a governance/privacy audit per idea listing specific Teams/Enterprise settings to use (data controls, retention flags, access scopes), note where learner data must be anonymized, and include at least three compliance checklist items to add to course deliverables (e.g., do not upload PHI; use synthetic data; enable workspace-level data retention = X days).\n\nStep 4 (measurable outcomes and final comparison): require idea_hater to produce measurable outcome metrics per module (e.g., Module 3 objective: produce a 3-slide data summary scored on defined rubric) and state which of the two ideas is stronger with a short justification tied to rubric scores and timeline feasibility.\n\nStep 5 (positioning and instructor/enterprise notes): require idea_maker to deliver the final chosen idea plus a concise positioning statement (target job roles, minimum prerequisites, measurable outcomes), a 3-line elevator pitch and a two-paragraph instructor note (expected class size, facilitator-to-learner ratio for labs, recommended hardware/software setup), and an Enterprise customization note listing which modules to swap or deepen for regulated domains (finance, health, legal).\n\nStep 5 (optional add-ons): require idea_maker to specify optional add-on micro-modules (1\u20134 hours) for high-demand deep dives (e.g., advanced retrieval via Knowledge files, building no-code Actions in Custom GPTs) so buyers can see upgrade paths.\n\nStep 6 (final deliverables and progression): require a five-sentence course description plus a bulleted list of four concrete learner deliverables (e.g., prompt library of X prompts, one Custom GPT scaffold with Knowledge file, a completed ADA notebook/report, governance checklist and SOP), a 30-second marketing blurb, and recommended next steps (two concrete follow-up modules with duration and learning outcome); require final title to signal format and depth (e.g., \u201c24-hour Intensive \u2014 Medium-level Technical Course (No-Code)\u201d).\n\nCross-step meta-change (shared templates & workload balance): require idea_maker and idea_hater to exchange and use a single shared artifact template set (syllabus.csv, rubric.csv, changelog.md) with naming conventions and deadlines so critiques and revisions are comparable; cap idea_hater critiques to a predictable size (e.g., 500\u2013800 words per idea) and require prioritized top-5 action items; limit idea_maker outputs in Step 1 to standardized templates plus one exemplar lab and require idea_hater to use numeric rubric to keep workload balanced and accelerate critiques.\n\n\n            ",

each must use the same machine-readable syllabus template (syllabus.csv).\n           - For each idea include: (a) a timeboxed module plan summing to 24 hours with durations (hh:mm), (b) 6\u20138 modules, each with 1\u20132 measurable learning objectives using Bloom\u2019s verbs (apply/analyze/evaluate), (c) a one-page course spec (title, target audience, prerequisites, total contact time), and (d) explicit tool coverage: Advanced Data Analysis, Browse, Vision (image/PDF/table), Image generation, file uploads/multi-file analysis, Custom Instructions/Memory, Custom GPTs (Builder, Knowledge files, no-code Actions), GPT Store, Teams/Enterprise features (shared workspaces, data controls, privacy).\n           - Provide one representative \u201clab script\u201d per idea (single exemplar): step-by-step no-code lab, sample input files, one sample prompt, and expected outputs to demonstrate feasibility; do not produce full labs for all modules at this step.\n           - Add a pre-course setup checklist per idea: required accounts, example datasets/files (CSV, PDFs), sample Knowledge files, Teams/Enterprise permissions, instructor prep time estimate.\n           - Include actionable prompt/workflow frameworks (ROLE\u2013TASK\u2013CONTEXT\u2013FORMAT\u2013CONSTRAINTS\u2013EVALUATION, ReAct-style tool usage, checklist prompts, prompt versioning/A-B evaluation, lightweight retrieval via Knowledge files) and domain-agnostic tracks/examples (marketing, ops, finance, HR, legal, product).\n           - Initialize and use shared artifact templates and naming conventions for all deliverables: syllabus.csv, rubric.csv, changelog.md (e.g., idea01_syllabus.csv); adhere to workload limits (standardized templates + one exemplar lab only).\n\n   - Step 2:\n         * sub-task: Critique the 5 ideas using a standardized rubric and prescribe fixes\n         * agent: idea_hater\n         * bullet points:\n           - Score each idea on a 1\u20135 rubric across: scaffolding, pacing (24h realism), lab depth (hands-on vs demo), no-code feasibility, domain adaptability, governance/compliance readiness; submit rubric.csv with scores and 2\u20133 sentence justification per criterion (max 500\u2013800 words per idea).\n           - Mark any idea with average score < 3.0 for drop or radical revision; provide 2\u20134 concrete, prescriptive improvements per idea (e.g., replace generic Vision demo with PDF-table extraction lab; reallocate 30 minutes from Module 4 to Module 2).\n           - Flag obsolete/risky assumptions (e.g., enterprise settings, privacy-sensitive data) and recommend exact contemporary alternatives or operational constraints.\n           - Rank all ideas, recommend at least one to drop, and identify the top two to refine; record prioritized top-5 action items per idea; update changelog.md with critiques and decisions; use shared templates and naming conventions.\n\n   - Step 3:\n         * sub-task: Select top two by rubric and deliver revised, comparable 24-hour syllabi and labs\n         * agent: idea_maker\n         * bullet points:\n           - Select the top two ideas based on Step 2 rubric; for each, provide a revised timeboxed 24-hour syllabus (syllabus.csv) with module-level learning objectives mapped to specific assessment artifacts.\n           - Deliver full lab plans for each module: step-by-step no-code flows, required sample files, instructor notes, expected artifacts; include concrete prompt/workflow templates per module using ROLE\u2013TASK\u2013CONTEXT\u2013FORMAT\u2013CONSTRAINTS\u2013EVALUATION and at least two prompt-versioning examples for A/B evaluation.\n           - Provide a complete assessment plan: rubrics for practical checkpoints and capstone with pass/fail criteria; include a short pre-course learner checklist and one-click shareable sample dataset/Knowledge file links or creation instructions.\n           - Produce an annotated changelog.md listing every Step 2 critique and how it was addressed; ensure explicit tool coverage (ADA, Browse, Vision, Image gen, file analysis, Memory/Custom Instructions, Custom GPTs with Knowledge/Actions [no-code], GPT Store, Teams/Enterprise settings).\n\n   - Step 4:\n         * sub-task: Run timeline simulation, rebalance, and perform governance/privacy audit; compare the two\n         * agent: idea_hater\n         * bullet points:\n           - Mock-teach each revised 24-hour schedule to identify overloaded modules (require > allocated time) and thin labs (insufficient steps to meet objectives); propose specific rebalancing actions per issue; keep critiques within 500\u2013800 words per idea and list prioritized top-5 action items.\n           - Conduct a governance/privacy audit for each idea: specify Teams/Enterprise settings (data controls, retention flags, access scopes), where anonymization is required, and add at least three compliance checklist items (e.g., do not upload PHI, use synthetic data, set workspace-level data retention = X days).\n           - Define measurable outcome metrics per module (e.g., Module 3: 3-slide ADA summary scored 1\u20134 on correctness, clarity, citation, reproducibility) and update rubric.csv if needed.\n           - State which idea is stronger, with a short justification tied to rubric scores and timeline feasibility; update changelog.md with findings and rebalancing recommendations.\n\n   - Step 5:\n         * sub-task: Choose final course idea; provide positioning, instructor notes, and enterprise options\n         * agent: idea_maker\n         * bullet points:\n           - Select the final idea weighing technical depth, tool coverage, actionable frameworks, no-code feasibility, governance readiness, and professional impact; justify selection briefly in changelog.md.\n           - Deliver a concise positioning statement: target job roles, minimum prerequisites, measurable outcomes; add a 3-line elevator pitch.\n           - Provide a two-paragraph instructor note: expected class size, facilitator-to-learner ratio for labs, recommended hardware/software setup.\n           - Include an Enterprise customization note: which modules to swap or deepen for regulated domains (finance, health, legal); specify optional add-on micro-modules (1\u20134 hours) for deep dives (e.g., advanced Knowledge retrieval, building no-code Actions in Custom GPTs).\n           - Ensure all outputs use shared templates and naming conventions (syllabus.csv, rubric.csv, changelog.md).\n\n   - Step 6:\n         * sub-task: Publish the final title and five-sentence description plus deliverables and progression\n         * agent: idea_maker\n         * bullet points:\n           - Provide a final title that clearly signals format and depth (e.g., \u201c24-hour Intensive \u2014 Medium-level Technical Course (No-Code)\u201d).\n           - Write a five-sentence course description highlighting concrete tools (ADA, Browse, Vision, Image gen, file upload, Memory/Custom Instructions, Custom GPTs with Knowledge/Actions [no-code], GPT Store, Teams/Enterprise features), frameworks, hands-on labs, assessments, and outcomes.\n           - Add a bulleted list of four concrete learner deliverables (e.g., prompt library of X prompts; one Custom GPT scaffold with Knowledge file; completed ADA notebook/report; governance checklist and SOP).\n           - Include a 30-second marketing blurb and recommended next steps: two follow-up modules with duration and learning outcomes.\n           - Confirm final artifacts are saved to shared templates (syllabus.csv, rubric.csv, changelog.md) with agreed naming conventions.",
