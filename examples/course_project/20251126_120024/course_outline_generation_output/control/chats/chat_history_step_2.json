Basic Computer Literacy\n**Explanation:**  \nParticipants must be comfortable navigating digital tools, managing files, and using web-based applications. This foundational skill ensures that learners can effectively interact with ChatGPT interfaces, access online resources, and participate in hands-on exercises without technical barriers.\n\n### 2. Familiarity with Business Processes and Challenges\n**Explanation:**  \nA working knowledge of common business workflows, pain points, and strategic objectives is essential. This background enables participants to contextualize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities within real-world business scenarios and to identify high-impact opportunities for AI-driven solutions.\n\n### 3. Introductory Understanding of Artificial Intelligence Concepts\n**Explanation:**  \nParticipants should recognize basic AI terminology (e.g., models, training, inference) and the general principles of machine learning. This prerequisite ensures that learners can follow discussions about model customization, limitations, and ethical considerations without confusion.\n\n### 4. Experience with Spreadsheets or Data Analysis Tools\n**Explanation:**  \nFamiliarity with tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, or basic data analysis platforms is important. Many business applications of ChatGPT involve data extraction, summarization, or integration with structured data, so this experience supports effective participation in practical exercises.\n\n### 5. (Recommended) Basic Exposure to APIs or Automation Tools\n**Explanation:**  \nWhile not strictly required, prior exposure to APIs (e.g., using Zapier, Postman, or simple scripting) or workflow automation tools will help participants more quickly grasp the concepts of integrating ChatGPT into business systems. This background accelerates learning in modules focused on API integration and automation.\n\n---\n\nThese prerequisites collectively ensure that participants are prepared to engage with both the technical and strategic dimensions of the course, maximizing their ability to master advanced ChatGPT features for complex business solutions.",
