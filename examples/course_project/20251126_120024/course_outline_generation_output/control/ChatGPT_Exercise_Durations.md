## Module 1: Foundations of ChatGPT in Business Contexts

**Exercise:**  
Case study analysis—matching business problems with ChatGPT solutions.

**Estimated Duration:**  
- Exercise: 20 minutes  
- Debrief: 10 minutes

**Justification:**  
This introductory exercise is designed to activate prior knowledge and encourage discussion. The task is conceptually straightforward, focusing on analysis and group discussion rather than technical implementation. Twenty minutes allows sufficient time for small groups to review cases and propose solutions, while a 10-minute debrief ensures key insights are shared.

## Module 3: Integrating ChatGPT via API—Automation and Workflow Enhancement

**Exercise:**  
Guided API integration with a sample business tool.

**Estimated Duration:**  
- Exercise: 40 minutes  
- Debrief: 15 minutes

**Justification:**  
API integration is technically involved, requiring participants to navigate documentation, authenticate, and connect ChatGPT to a business application. Forty minutes is necessary for step-by-step guidance, troubleshooting, and successful completion. The extended debrief (15 minutes) supports discussion of integration challenges and lessons learned.

## Module 4: Custom Model Training and Fine-Tuning for Business Needs

**Exercise:**  
Developing a fine-tuning strategy for a business case.

**Estimated Duration:**  
- Exercise: 35 minutes  
- Debrief: 10 minutes

**Justification:**  
Custom model training involves planning data selection, defining objectives, and outlining evaluation metrics. While the exercise is conceptual rather than technical (no actual model training occurs), it requires thoughtful analysis and group collaboration. Thirty-five minutes allows for in-depth planning, with a 10-minute debrief to compare strategies.
