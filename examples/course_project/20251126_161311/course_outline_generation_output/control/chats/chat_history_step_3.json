Each module integrates both theoretical understanding and practical, hands-on exercises, ensuring participants develop actionable skills for professional productivity.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to ChatGPT and Conversational AI\n**Focus:**  \nEstablishes foundational knowledge of large language models (LLMs), the evolution of conversational AI, and the core principles behind ChatGPT. Sets expectations for the course and contextualizes AI\u2019s role in modern professional environments.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Navigating the ChatGPT Interface and Core Features\n**Focus:**  \nGuides participants through the ChatGPT web interface, including conversation management, session history, settings, and account features. Emphasizes efficient navigation and basic troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Prompt Engineering: Crafting Effective Inputs\n**Focus:**  \nIntroduces the art and science of prompt engineering. Participants learn to design clear, targeted prompts to elicit high-quality, relevant responses from ChatGPT, with hands-on experimentation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Evaluating and Refining AI Outputs\n**Focus:**  \nDevelops critical skills for assessing the accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness of ChatGPT\u2019s responses. Covers techniques for iterative refinement and recognizing limitations or biases.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Advanced Features: Plugins, Extensions, and Integrations\n**Focus:**  \nExplores advanced ChatGPT capabilities, including enabling and using official plugins (e.g., web browsing, code interpreter), browser extensions, and third-party integrations with productivity tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Office).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Customizing ChatGPT for Domain-Specific Tasks\n**Focus:**  \nDemonstrates how to adapt ChatGPT for specific professional contexts (e.g., marketing, HR, project management). Includes case studies and hands-on labs for tailoring prompts and workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collaborative and Group Use of ChatGPT\n**Focus:**  \nExamines strategies for leveraging ChatGPT in team settings, including collaborative brainstorming, co-authoring documents, and facilitating group problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Strategic Planning and Responsible AI Adoption\n**Focus:**  \nGuides participants in developing a strategic plan for integrating ChatGPT into their personal and organizational workflows. Addresses ethical, privacy, and security considerations, and provides a roadmap for ongoing skill development and responsible use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Progression:**\n- Modules 1\u20132: Build foundational understanding and tool familiarity.\n- Modules 3\u20134: Develop core operational skills in prompt engineering and output evaluation.\n- Modules 5\u20136: Expand capabilities with advanced features and domain customization.\n- Modules 7\u20138: Address collaborative use and strategic, ethical integration for sustained professional impact.\n\nThis structure ensures a logical, cumulative learning journey, balancing conceptual knowledge with practical, real-world application at every stage.",
