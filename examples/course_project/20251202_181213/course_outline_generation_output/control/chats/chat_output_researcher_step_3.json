Each module builds on the skills and concepts introduced in previous sessions, ensuring a logical progression and comprehensive coverage of all major tools and features.\n\n---\n\n## 1. LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Mechanics\n**Focus:**  \nEstablishes foundational understanding of large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering using the RTCFCE framework. Participants learn to craft, test, and evaluate prompts for clarity, accuracy, and constraint adherence.\n\n**Progression:**  \nServes as the entry point, ensuring all participants have a shared vocabulary and baseline skills for interacting with ChatGPT.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Context Engineering & Memory/Custom Instructions\n**Focus:**  \nExplores strategies for providing context to ChatGPT, including the use of Custom Instructions and Memory. Participants learn to personalize outputs, manage domain-specific glossaries, and apply privacy best practices.\n\n**Progression:**  \nBuilds on prompt mechanics by introducing persistent context and user-specific customization, setting the stage for more complex, context-aware workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Web-Grounded Research with Browse\n**Focus:**  \nIntroduces the Browse feature for real-time web research. Participants practice sourcing, evaluating, and citing up-to-date information, emphasizing credibility and recency.\n\n**Progression:**  \nExtends context engineering to external data sources, reinforcing prompt and context skills in a research setting.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) for Pros\n**Focus:**  \nCovers Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) capabilities, including multi-file uploads, KPI computation, and data visualization. Participants analyze synthetic datasets and narrate findings.\n\n**Progression:**  \nTransitions from text-based tasks to structured data analysis, integrating file handling and quantitative reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Document & Table Intelligence (Vision)\n**Focus:**  \nUtilizes Vision features to extract structured data from PDFs and images, correct OCR errors, and validate outputs. Emphasizes document processing and quality assurance.\n\n**Progression:**  \nBuilds on ADA by introducing unstructured data sources and multimodal analysis, increasing task complexity.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Image Generation & Multimodal Workflows\n**Focus:**  \nIntroduces image generation and multimodal workflows, integrating brand guidelines and accessibility requirements. Participants create, refine, and assess images for business use.\n\n**Progression:**  \nExpands multimodal capabilities, requiring synthesis of text, image, and brand constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Custom GPTs: Builder, Knowledge, No-Code Actions (Simulated)\n**Focus:**  \nGuides participants through designing and testing Custom GPTs using Builder, Knowledge files, and simulated no-code Actions. Covers system prompt engineering, retrieval quality, and store listing preparation.\n\n**Progression:**  \nMoves from using built-in features to creating custom, reusable AI tools, emphasizing modularity and deployment.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Teams/Enterprise Governance & Capstone\n**Focus:**  \nAddresses governance, privacy, and compliance in Teams/Enterprise environments. Participants execute a capstone workflow, integrating multiple tools and producing SOPs and governance checklists.\n\n**Progression:**  \nCulminates in an end-to-end, real-world workflow that synthesizes all prior skills, with a strong focus on compliance and operationalization.\n\n---\n\n**Progression Summary:**  \nThe course begins with foundational prompt and context skills, then incrementally introduces external data, structured analysis, multimodal processing, and custom tool creation. It concludes with governance and a capstone project, ensuring participants can confidently deploy no-code AI solutions in professional settings.\n\n**Coverage of Tools and Features:**  \n- Prompting frameworks, Custom Instructions/Memory (Modules 1\u20132)\n- Browse (Module 3)\n- Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), multi-file uploads (Module 4)\n- Vision (PDF/image analysis), ADA validation (Module 5)\n- Image Generation, Vision (Module 6)\n- Custom GPT Builder, Knowledge files, simulated Actions, GPT Store (Module 7)\n- Teams/Enterprise features, privacy, governance (Module 8)\n\nThis sequence ensures a logical, scaffolded progression from foundational to advanced competencies, with explicit tool coverage and increasing complexity at each stage.",
