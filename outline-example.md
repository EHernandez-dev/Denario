# Detailed Description of the Full-Day Workshops
### Overview: 
This one-day, hands-on course is designed for professionals who want to integrate ChatGPT into their daily work. No technical background is required. Across 8 focused blocks, participants will learn how to use ChatGPT effectively, responsibly, and efficiently to solve real-world problems. Each 45-minute block combines expert instruction, a guided hands-on exercise, and a short discussion to ensure concepts are immediately applicable.

## 1. Discovering Everyday AI Use Cases & Writing Effective Prompts
### Description: 
We begin with two foundational skills: identifying everyday use cases for AI in your own work, and learning how to write effective prompts to support those tasks. You’ll explore real applications like drafting emails, generating marketing content, and more—while learning how to frame requests so AI Tools deliver useful, relevant responses.
### Takeaways:
You’ll leave with 2–3 prompts that already help you at work.
Understand how to frame requests clearly and effectively.
Identify real use-cases where AI can support your daily work.
### Learning Goals:
- Participants identify at least two tasks from their own work where ChatGPT could provide support (e.g., drafting emails or generating slides).
- Participants navigate the ChatGPT interface by opening a chat, entering a simple prompt, and reviewing the generated response.
- Participants compare the Chatting-Strategy with the One-Prompt-Strategy and discuss when to use which.
### Exercise Description:
Duration: 20 minutes, Debrief: 10 minutes

## 2. Prompt and context engineering 
### Description: 
Once you know the basics, we’ll dive deeper into advanced techniques like the RTF framework (Role, Task, Format), Chain-of-Thought prompting, and context management. These strategies help unlock better performance from ChatGPT in more complex or nuanced tasks.
### Takeaways:
- Understand how to shape ChatGPT’s behavior and output.
- Learn how to improve results by structuring your prompts.
- Gain transferable prompting strategies for new scenarios.
### Learning goals:
- Participants apply the RTF (Role-Task-Format) framework to design at least one structured prompt for a complex or nuanced task.
- Participants modify a basic prompt by adding context or constraints (e.g., personal preferences for a Paris itinerary) to achieve more tailored and relevant results.
- Participants recognize the concept of “context engineering” and build up context in a chat by adding it to prompts or asking strategic questions before sending their actual prompt.
 
## 3. Using AI Responsibly
### Description: 
AI tools are powerful—but they’re not perfect. In this session, we’ll cover ethical and practical guidelines for safe, responsible use of AI chat tools. You’ll learn about hallucinations, when to keep a human in the loop, and how to protect sensitive data.
### Takeaways:
- Learn how to fact-check ChatGPT.
- Understand boundaries of AI use in sensitive contexts.
- Know when and how to keep a human in the loop.
### Learning goals:
- Participants identify at least one example of a hallucination in a ChatGPT response and explain why the output is unreliable.
- Participants describe two scenarios in their own work where AI use would require human oversight or additional review.
- Participants formulate one guideline for avoiding the sharing of sensitive or personal data when using ChatGPT.
- Participants evaluate an AI-generated response for ethical or practical risks and propose at least one adjustment to ensure responsible use.

## 4. Choosing Models and Modes
### Description: 
ChatGPT has several models and modes. This session helps you select the best one for your task—whether you’re writing, calculating, researching, or analyzing an image. You will learn when to use reasoning models, Code Interpreters or Web Search and how to write the perfect prompt for a Deep Research Report. 
### Takeaways:
- Learn which model to use for which type of task.
- Know how and when to switch between modes.
- Use Deep Research and web search to improve accuracy.
### Learning goals:
Participants distinguish between reasoning models and standard models by comparing their outputs on a task that requires structured reasoning.
Participants select the appropriate mode (standard, web search, or research) for at least two different tasks and justify their choice based on the task requirements.
Participants write a prompt for a Deep Research report and evaluate how research mode improves depth and factual accuracy compared to standard mode.
Participants identify at least one scenario where web search mode is essential for obtaining up-to-date information, and demonstrate how to enable and use it effectively.
Participants explain how choosing the correct model or mode is part of responsible AI use by citing one example where using the wrong mode could lead to inaccurate or incomplete results.
## 5. Personalizing ChatGPT for Your Workflow
### Description: This session introduces personalization tools that make ChatGPT work better for you. We’ll cover memory, projects, and how to set up system instructions that match your style and goals. We’ll also explore how custom GPTs allow you to create purpose-built assistants tailored to specific workflows or roles. 
### Takeaways:
- Build a version of ChatGPT tailored to your daily needs.
- Use projects to organize ongoing tasks.
- Understand ChatGPT's Memory feature and configure it to your needs.
### Learning Goals:
- Participants draft custom instructions that align ChatGPT’s tone and style with their professional needs (e.g., formal vs. conversational).
- Participants verify the effect of custom instructions by testing and comparing outputs before and after applying it.
- Participants add at least one contextual memory within a conversation and test how it influences the quality and relevance of ChatGPT’s responses.
- Participants remove or update a memory entry to understand how curating memory ensures accurate and relevant outputs over time.
- Participants create a new project and configure its system prompt to suit a specific recurring task or workflow.
- Participants upload or attach a file to a project and evaluate how adding context improves ChatGPT’s ability to generate relevant outputs.
- Participants describe one use case where sharing a CustomGPT would benefit collaboration with colleagues or a team.
- Participants compare a CustomGPT with a ChatGPT project and list at least two advantages or limitations of each approach for specific tasks.
- Participants explain the relationship between custom instructions, memories, projects, and CustomGPTs by mapping how each tool can influence ChatGPT’s behavior.
- Participants discuss the most effective personalization approach (custom instructions, memory, project, or CustomGPT) for a given scenario and justify their reasoning.

## 6. When ChatGPT Isn’t Enough: Next-Level AI Tools
### Description: ChatGPT is powerful, but not always the final answer. This session introduces advanced tools and approaches that extend its usefulness—like document-aware apps (RAG), automation platforms, and AI agents. We will not cover how to use those tools but create awareness for situations that might require them. 
### Takeaways:
- Know when to reach beyond ChatGPT.
### Learning goals:
- Participants identify at least two scenarios where ChatGPT alone may be insufficient (e.g., complex document search or multi-step automation).
- Participants describe, in simple terms, what tools like RAG or AI agents offer that extend ChatGPT’s capabilities.
