It addresses any gaps in digital literacy or AI familiarity, ensuring all participants start with a shared understanding. This module is essential as it sets the context for all subsequent learning, introduces the interface, and frames the strategic value of ChatGPT in business.\n\n## Module 2: Fundamentals of Prompt Crafting\n**Rationale:**  \nBuilding on the introductory knowledge, this module focuses on the essential skill of prompt engineering. Participants learn how to formulate clear, effective prompts to guide ChatGPT\u2019s outputs. This is a critical competency, as the quality of prompts directly impacts the usefulness of AI-generated communication. The module scaffolds learning by moving from simple to more nuanced prompt structures.\n\n## Module 3: Context Management and Multi-Turn Conversations\n**Rationale:**  \nAfter mastering basic prompt crafting, participants progress to managing context in ongoing dialogues. This module addresses the complexities of multi-turn interactions, teaching strategies to maintain coherence and relevance in extended conversations with ChatGPT. It builds on the prompt engineering skills from Module 2 and introduces techniques for structuring business dialogues.\n\n## Module 4: Applying ChatGPT to Real-World Business Scenarios\n**Rationale:**  \nWith foundational and intermediate skills established, this module immerses participants in practical application. Through scenario-based exercises, participants apply ChatGPT to common business tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and brainstorming. This module leverages prior learning and emphasizes transfer to authentic business contexts.\n\n## Module 5: Advanced Features and Customization\n**Rationale:**  \nThis module introduces advanced ChatGPT functionalities, such as custom instructions, integrations, and plugins. It is positioned after participants have gained confidence with core features, enabling them to explore and experiment with more sophisticated tools for business process optimization and workflow automation.\n\n## Module 6: Responsible AI Use, Trust, and Accountability\n**Rationale:**  \nAs participants become adept at using ChatGPT, it is critical to address ethical considerations, responsible use, and trust. This module covers risk identification, bias mitigation, and accountability measures, ensuring participants can evaluate and validate AI outputs in sensitive business contexts. It builds on all previous modules by contextualizing technical skills within a framework of responsible practice.\n\n## Module 7: Collaborative Practice, Role-Playing, and Peer Feedback\n**Rationale:**  \nThe final module consolidates learning through interactive group activities, role-playing, and structured peer feedback. Participants engage in collaborative exercises that simulate real-world business communication challenges, reinforcing skills from all previous modules. This capstone experience fosters reflection, peer learning, and practical mastery.\n\n---\n\n**Logical Flow and Progression:**\n\n- The course begins with foundational knowledge (Module 1), ensuring all participants are equipped for hands-on engagement.\n- It then moves to the core technical skill of prompt crafting (Module 2), followed by the more complex task of managing context in conversations (Module 3).\n- Practical application is emphasized next (Module 4), allowing participants to transfer skills to authentic business scenarios.\n- Advanced features are introduced once participants are comfortable with the basics (Module 5).\n- Responsible and ethical use is addressed after technical mastery is established (Module 6).\n- The course culminates in collaborative, interactive practice (Module 7), ensuring skills are internalized and transferable to participants\u2019 work environments.\n\nThis progression ensures a scaffolded, logical learning journey from foundational understanding to advanced, responsible, and collaborative application of ChatGPT in business communication.",
