    "content": "**Ideas:**\n   - Idea 1: AI-Assisted Scientific Microservice in a Day (FastAPI + Copilot Chat + ChatGPT)\n         * What it is: Build a single scientific endpoint (e.g., POST /simulate/sir) with strict Pydantic validation, negative tests, and a Dockerized FastAPI service, using Copilot Chat for scaffolding and ChatGPT for contract-first OpenAPI design.\n         * Strengths: Concrete, portfolio-ready deliverable; clear contract-first workflow; strong relevance for exposing models/algorithms as services.\n         * Risks/feasibility: Tooling friction (Docker, network/firewalls, AI access), high cognitive load (OpenAPI + Pydantic + tests + Docker in 1 day), performance/coverage targets can be unrealistic under time pressure.\n         * Measurable outcomes (if selected): 1 working endpoint + /health; OpenAPI docs render; validation blocks \u226510 predefined negative cases; route/validation test coverage \u226570%; local latency <300 ms; time-to-scaffold reduced by ~50% versus manual baseline.\n         * Verdict: Not selected. Despite strong outcomes, the setup risks and multi-skill demands raise failure probability for a 1-day mixed-skill STEM audience.\n\n   - Idea 2: AI-Assisted Legacy Code Deep-Dive: Explain \u2192 Test \u2192 Refactor \u2192 Minimal Port\n         * What it is: Use Copilot Chat and ChatGPT to generate explanations and docstrings, create golden-master tests for a curated legacy numerical snippet, refactor safely under test, and optionally port one self-contained function with parity checks.\n         * Strengths: Directly addresses common STEM pain (understanding/refactoring legacy code) with lower tooling friction; clear, staged pipeline; strong guardrails (golden-master, tolerances, typing) to keep AI on track.\n         * Feasibility mitigations: Provide prompt templates, realistic numeric tolerances (e.g., atol=1e-9), optional porting, and a preconfigured environment (devcontainer or requirements.txt) with local fallback to avoid environment drift.\n         * Measurable outcomes: \n           - Documentation coverage: 100% of functions gain docstrings + high-level module summary.\n           - Test quality: golden-master tests pass; line coverage 75\u201385%; \u226510 edge cases captured; flakiness <1% with seeded RNG.\n           - Code quality: mypy clean (0 errors); ruff clean (0 violations); cyclomatic complexity reduced by 20\u201340%; function length reduced by 15\u201330% without behavior change.\n           - Correctness: parity vs reference within atol=1e-9; covariance PSD check passes on all fixtures.\n           - Productivity: time-to-understand (measured by task completion of a comprehension quiz) reduced by ~40\u201360% compared to baseline; AI assist acceptance rate \u226550% with post-edit deltas tracked.\n         * Verdict: Selected. It maximizes likelihood of success in one day, targets a ubiquitous STEM need, and offers clear, verifiable gains in maintainability, correctness, and comprehension with quantifiable metrics (coverage, complexity reduction, parity tolerances, and time-to-understand improvements).",
