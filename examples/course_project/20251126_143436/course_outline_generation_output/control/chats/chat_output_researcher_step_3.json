The modules are sequenced to build knowledge and skills progressively, integrating both theoretical concepts and hands-on practice.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to AI and ChatGPT in Business\n**Focus:**  \nEstablishes foundational knowledge of artificial intelligence, with emphasis on generative AI and ChatGPT. Explains core concepts, terminology, and the relevance of AI to modern business operations. Sets expectations for what ChatGPT can and cannot do.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering\n**Focus:**  \nIntroduces the principles of prompt engineering, including how to craft clear, effective prompts for ChatGPT. Covers prompt structure, specificity, and techniques for guiding AI outputs. Includes practical exercises to reinforce learning.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Contextualizing Business Challenges for AI\n**Focus:**  \nTeaches participants how to analyze and frame business problems so that ChatGPT can provide relevant, actionable solutions. Explores methods for providing context, structuring input data, and aligning AI outputs with business objectives.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Strategic Applications: Use Cases and Workflows\n**Focus:**  \nExamines real-world business use cases where ChatGPT adds value (e.g., customer support, report generation, brainstorming, process automation). Guides participants in mapping their own business processes to potential AI-driven solutions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Evaluating and Iterating AI Outputs\n**Focus:**  \nDevelops skills for critically assessing ChatGPT responses for accuracy, relevance, and bias. Introduces feedback loops and iterative prompt refinement to improve output quality. Includes hands-on review and revision exercises.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Ethical, Legal, and Responsible AI Use\n**Focus:**  \nAddresses ethical considerations, privacy, compliance, and risk management when deploying ChatGPT in business. Discusses best practices for responsible AI adoption and organizational safeguards.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Implementing and Scaling AI Solutions in the Workplace\n**Focus:**  \nCovers strategies for integrating ChatGPT into business workflows, fostering team adoption, and managing change. Includes collaborative workshops for developing action plans and sharing best practices.\n\n---\n\nThis modular structure ensures a logical progression from foundational understanding to advanced, actionable skills, with each module building on the previous one.
