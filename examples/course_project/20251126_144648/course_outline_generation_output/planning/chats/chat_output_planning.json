This supports clear module progression.\n  \n- For Step 4, recommend including a bullet to explicitly mention that the descriptions and takeaways should reflect practical, real-world business scenarios. Also, ask to ensure that the estimated durations for hands-on exercises are realistic, leaving room for interactive Q&A sessions.\n  \n- For Step 5, suggest adding a bullet to ensure that the markdown outline incorporates clear hierarchy (using headers and subheaders) and numbering, making it easier for future adaptation and reviews.\n\nThese recommendations refine the plan by adding clarity, ensuring detailed coverage of prerequisites, balanced module progression, and a more user-friendly final course outline.",
