Test with a single-sentence \u201cstyle probe\u201d prompt to verify; Step 2 (RTCE draft): \u201cRole: Senior policy analyst | Task: Convert a stakeholder memo to a 1\u2011page brief | Constraints: \u2264450 words, 3 bullets for risks, APA citations | Examples: Provide 1 exemplar brief.\u201d; Step 3 (Context packaging): Upload memo.pdf; in the prompt, use separators like ===MEMO=== ... ===END===; request a rolling summary if long; Step 4 (Schema guarding): \u201cOutput two parts: (A) Markdown brief with headings; (B) JSON metadata: {\u2018title\u2019:\u2018\u2019, \u2018audience\u2019:\u2018\u2019, \u2018risk_level\u2019:\u2018low|med|high\u2019, \u2018citations\u2019:[...]}. If schema invalid, self-correct.\u201d; Step 5 (Verification chain): Use Browsing to fetch and cite two corroborating sources. Add a \u201cred team\u201d self-critique paragraph and a risk note; Step 6 (A/B compare): Create Variant A (formal) vs. Variant B (plain language). Use Compare to pick best against a rubric (clarity, completeness, citations); Step 7 (Mini eval set with ADA): Upload 10 short memos.csv. Ask ADA to run the prompt template across each row, score clarity/completeness/citation presence (1\u20135), and produce a scorecard + recommendations to tighten constraints; Step 8 (Finalize): Save the winning template, JSON schema, and quality checklist; create a shared link to your \u201cbrief generator\u201d thread as a handoff artifact.\n\t\t- Deliverables by end of course: A reusable prompt library (at least 12 templates across 3 task families: emails/briefs/reports); a schema pack (JSON/table patterns) with \u201cself-repair\u201d instructions; a mini evaluation scorecard and quality checklist for stakeholder review (sandboxed, review-ready).\n\t\t- Feasibility upgrades from critique: Narrow scope to high-frequency tasks, provide starter assets (sample memos, schema stubs, rubrics); replace deep A/B testing with the Compare feature and a 10\u2011case eval set via ADA.\n\n- Idea 2:\n\t* Data-to-Decision: No\u2011Code Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting with Advanced Data Analysis\n\t\t- What it is: A practical, no-code analysis track that turns spreadsheets and PDFs into validated insights and executive-ready narratives using Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), with curated case studies and reproducible playbooks.\n\t\t- Tools and features covered: Advanced Data Analysis (data cleaning, joins, pivots, visualizations, simple modeling), file uploads (multi-file), Browsing for definitions/citations as needed, structured outputs to CSV/JSON, chart exports, and shared links.\n\t\t- Core frameworks: Question\u2192Analysis Scaffold: Business Question \u2192 Hypothesis \u2192 Tests \u2192 Evidence \u2192 Message; Insight Tree: Organize signals (trend, segment, anomaly, driver) before writing the story; Validation Prompts: \u201cShow assumptions, print head(), report missingness, justify chart choice\u201d; Repro Playbook: Save instructions + input template; re-run with new data with minimal changes; Confidence and Caveats: Always output assumptions, data gaps, and next-step checks.\n\t\t- Step-by-step example (marketing performance case): Step 1 (Ingest and audit): Upload campaigns.csv and spend.csv. Prompt ADA: \u201cSummarize columns, infer types, print first 5 rows, missingness matrix, and a data dictionary.\u201d; Step 2 (Clean and join): \u201cStandardize date columns; align campaign_id; inner join; list any mismatches; create a \u2018join_issues.csv\u2019 of unmatched rows.\u201d; Step 3 (Core analysis): \u201cCreate a pivot: ROI by channel and week; identify top/bottom 3 segments; check seasonality; run a simple regression of conversions ~ spend + channel dummies; report coefficients with plain-English interpretation.\u201d; Step 4 (Visualization spec prompting): \u201cProduce three charts: (1) Weekly ROI by channel (line), (2) Spend vs. conversions with regression line (scatter), (3) Top 5 campaigns by ROI (bar). Use accessible colors, labeled axes, and export PNGs.\u201d; Step 5 (Insight tree + executive story): \u201cOrganize findings as trend/segment/driver/anomaly; draft a 200\u2011word executive summary plus a 1\u2011page appendix with methods and caveats.\u201d; Step 6 (Validation): \u201cList assumptions; run a sensitivity check dropping outliers > P95; re-run key charts; compare differences; state confidence level (low/med/high).\u201d; Step 7 (Reproducibility): \u201cPackage code and prompts in a playbook; export clean dataset, charts, and a \u2018report.md\u2019; provide a re-run instruction block that accepts a new campaigns_YYYYMM.csv.\u201d\n\t\t- Deliverables by end of course: A working ADA notebook-style thread with an analysis playbook and reusable prompt blocks; cleaned/joined dataset, exported charts, and an executive-ready report with an appendix; a validation checklist and a \u201cnew data re-run\u201d template for future analyses.\n\t\t- Feasibility upgrades from critique: Use curated datasets with known quirks; embed validation prompts in each step; emphasize reproducible playbooks over exhaustive statistics; focus on decision-ready insight flow.\n\n        ",
