context packaging (delimiters, variables, rolling summaries); schema-guarded outputs (JSON/tables); iterative prompting and self\u2011critique; response benchmarking/A-B via Compare; Custom Instructions, Memory, Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), Browsing, file uploads, shared links.\n         * Critique summary: High relevance and strong deliverables; risk of trying too much in 24 hours (benchmarking, governance), dependence on advanced features, and need for clearer pedagogy and compliance guidance.\n         * Tools integration: Balanced core ChatGPT features (Custom Instructions, Memory, file uploads) with medium-level practices (schema-guarding, evaluation sets) to produce repeatable, auditable outputs.\n\n   - Idea 2: Build Your Departmental Co\u2011Pilot: Custom GPTs, Knowledge, and Actions (Original)\n         * What it was: A no\u2011code track to design specialized assistants using Custom GPTs with Knowledge packs and Actions for team workflows (e.g., legal review, sales briefs).\n         * Technical depth and features: GPT Builder; Knowledge uploads; conversation starters; output presets; schema\u2011guided outputs; Access controls; versioning; Actions via OpenAPI specs; governance checklists and evaluation sets.\n         * Critique summary: High organizational value but heavy IT/permissions dependencies; scope too large for individuals in 24 hours; best for managers with support.\n         * Tools integration: Deep use of Custom GPT ecosystem and schema outputs; practical governance framing but feasibility limited by infrastructure and approvals for a short workshop.\n\n   - Idea 3: Data\u2011to\u2011Decision: Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting with Advanced Data Analysis (Original)\n         * What it was: Turn spreadsheets/CSVs/PDFs into insights and executive narratives using ADA, with validation and reproducible playbooks.\n         * Technical depth and features: ADA for cleaning, joins, pivots, visualization, light modeling; structured outputs to CSV/JSON; chart spec prompting; batch runs; shared links; Browsing for definitions/citations.\n         * Critique summary: Strong practical payoff; time pressure on full analysis stack; over-reliance on ADA; risk of statistical misinterpretation without guidance.\n         * Tools integration: Showcased ADA as the primary engine with scaffolded prompts and validation steps; reproducibility via templated threads and exports.\n\n   - Idea 4: Multimodal Mastery: Vision, Voice, and Document Automation for Professionals (Original)\n         * What it was: Apply Vision, voice, and document handling to audits, reviews, and content creation (e.g., table extraction, redlining, mockups).\n         * Technical depth and features: Vision for image/diagram/table understanding; PDF/doc uploads; voice mode; image generation; layout-aware extraction prompts; style-transfer with few-shot examples; structured outputs.\n         * Critique summary: High-value differentiators but risk of shallow coverage across too many modalities; device and platform variability complicate labs.\n         * Tools integration: Emphasized multimodal workflows and structured outputs; needed tighter scoping and standardized assets to fit 24 hours.\n\n   - Idea 5: Reliable AI at Work: Verification, Safety, and Compliance Playbook (Original)\n         * What it was: Methods to ensure outputs are trustable, traceable, and compliant through verification chains, self-critique, and evaluation.\n         * Technical depth and features: Browsing for citations; ADA for batch evaluation and rubric scoring; Memory/Custom Instructions for guardrails; shared links for audits; evaluation sets; schema\u2011locked outputs; human escalation triggers.\n         * Critique summary: Essential topic but risks generic guidance across domains; complex org rollouts exceed 24 hours; best as a playbook + starter artifacts.\n         * Tools integration: Strong on verification and auditability using schema outputs and evaluation sets; needed domain-specific tailoring and IT/legal pathways.\n\n   - Idea 6: Prompt-to-Production (Improved)\n         * Improvements applied: Tightened scope to high-frequency tasks (emails/briefs/reports); provided prebuilt schemas/rubrics; timeboxed labs; hybrid evaluation (ADA + human rubric); compliance mini\u2011module; feature fallbacks for no ADA/Browsing environments.\n         * Step-by-step exemplar: Policy brief generator with Custom Instructions, RTCE framing, context packaging and rolling summaries, schema-guarded outputs with self-repair, Browsing-backed verification, Compare for A/B, ADA mini eval set, and shared-link handoff.\n         * Deliverables and feasibility: Reusable prompt library (\u224812 templates), schema pack, hybrid evaluation scorecard, quality checklist; sandboxed, review-ready outputs instead of \u201cproduction.\u201d\n         * Technical integration: Demonstrated medium-level mastery with structured outputs, evaluation sets, and verification chains while ensuring progress with feature fallbacks.\n\n   - Idea 7: Data\u2011to\u2011Decision (Improved)\n         * Improvements applied: Curated case studies with known quirks; simplified stats to core comparisons; explicit validation prompts and human sign-offs; fallback paths if ADA unavailable; decision checklists and clear deliverable scope.\n         * Step-by-step exemplar: Data audit, clean/join with mismatch export, core analysis (pivots, regression-lite), chart spec prompting, insight tree + executive narrative, sensitivity checks, reproducible re-run template.\n         * Deliverables and feasibility: ADA notebook-style thread, cleaned dataset, charts, executive report, validation checklist, re-run instructions; balanced rigor with time constraints.\n         * Technical integration: ADA-centric pipeline with structured logging, CSV/JSON exports, and reproducible prompts; human-in-the-loop checkpoints to mitigate misuse.\n\n   - Idea 8: Final Selection and Rationale\n         * Selected course: Prompt\u2011to\u2011Production: ChatGPT Power\u2011User Proficiency for Professionals (No Code).\n         * Rationale: Best cross\u2011functional fit; teaches universally applicable skills (prompt framing, context control, structured outputs, verification) with clear deliverables and immediate workplace utility\u2014without requiring coding.\n         * Technical depth: Integrates Custom Instructions/Memory, file uploads, schema-guarded outputs with self\u2011repair, Compare, Browsing for source-backed verification, ADA for mini eval sets; includes fallbacks where features are unavailable.\n         * Feasibility and pedagogy: Timeboxed labs, prebuilt assets, hybrid evaluation, and a compliance/PII mini\u2011module address earlier critiques on scope, bias, and governance; outputs are sandboxed and stakeholder\u2011review ready.\n         * Outcome alignment: Learners leave with a prompt library, schema pack, and evaluation kit\u2014actionable frameworks that reflect medium-level ChatGPT capabilities and real-world constraints.",
