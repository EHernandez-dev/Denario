While it covers model selection and structured prompting, it may need additional modules explicitly focused on troubleshooting challenges and optimizing prompt performance.\n   - Additional emphasis on how to integrate advanced tools with the inherent strengths of various models\u2014as well as discussions on the limitations and trade-offs\u2014would provide a more robust and complete learning experience.\n\n\u2022 Idea 2: Advanced Features for Complex Problem Solving\n   - This course effectively delves into the advanced features of ChatGPT, including specific aspects like API integrations and custom model training, which are directly relevant for addressing intricate business challenges.\n   - The structured progression from basic to complex problem-solving is commendable and aligns with the educational needs of business professionals who are looking to enhance their technical mastery.\n   - One potential issue is that the scope may be too broad. The course should consider narrowing its focus on fewer key advanced features to allow for deeper exploration rather than a more superficial overview.\n   - Additionally, while the course promises practical exercises, it would be beneficial to ensure that these exercises are firmly anchored in explicit business use cases, enhancing the relevance of structured prompting techniques within real-world scenarios.\n   - More explicit guidance on how to transition from theoretical knowledge to hands-on application in a business environment could further bridge any gaps in content depth or practical application.",
