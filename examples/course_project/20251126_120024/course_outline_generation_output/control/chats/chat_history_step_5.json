The following analysis identifies which modules include practical exercises, provides estimated durations for each, and justifies these estimates based on the complexity and learning objectives of the activities.\n\n---\n\n## Module 1: Foundations of ChatGPT in Business Contexts\n\n**Exercise:**  \nCase study analysis\u2014matching business problems with ChatGPT solutions.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 20 minutes  \n- Debrief: 10 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis introductory exercise is designed to activate prior knowledge and encourage discussion. The task is conceptually straightforward, focusing on analysis and group discussion rather than technical implementation. Twenty minutes allows sufficient time for small groups to review cases and propose solutions, while a 10-minute debrief ensures key insights are shared.\n\n---\n\n## Module 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering for Business Solutions\n\n**Exercise:**  \nIterative prompt design and testing for business tasks.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 30 minutes  \n- Debrief: 10 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nPrompt engineering requires iterative experimentation and peer feedback. Thirty minutes provides adequate time for participants to design, test, and refine prompts across several business scenarios. The debrief allows for sharing optimization strategies and discussing prompt effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n## Module 3: Integrating ChatGPT via API\u2014Automation and Workflow Enhancement\n\n**Exercise:**  \nGuided API integration with a sample business tool.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 40 minutes  \n- Debrief: 15 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nAPI integration is technically involved, requiring participants to navigate documentation, authenticate, and connect ChatGPT to a business application. Forty minutes is necessary for step-by-step guidance, troubleshooting, and successful completion. The extended debrief (15 minutes) supports discussion of integration challenges and lessons learned.\n\n---\n\n## Module 4: Custom Model Training and Fine-Tuning for Business Needs\n\n**Exercise:**  \nDeveloping a fine-tuning strategy for a business case.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 35 minutes  \n- Debrief: 10 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nCustom model training involves planning data selection, defining objectives, and outlining evaluation metrics. While the exercise is conceptual rather than technical (no actual model training occurs), it requires thoughtful analysis and group collaboration. Thirty-five minutes allows for in-depth planning, with a 10-minute debrief to compare strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Module 5: Data Privacy, Security, and Compliance in AI Deployments\n\n**Exercise:**  \nScenario-based compliance and risk mitigation planning.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 20 minutes  \n- Debrief: 10 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis exercise is focused on critical thinking and application of best practices to a realistic scenario. The complexity lies in identifying risks and proposing mitigation strategies, which can be accomplished in a focused 20-minute session, followed by a concise debrief.\n\n---\n\n## Module 6: Designing and Prototyping ChatGPT-Powered Business Solutions\n\n**Exercise:**  \nCapstone project\u2014designing and presenting a prototype solution.\n\n**Estimated Duration:**  \n- Exercise: 50 minutes  \n- Debrief: 20 minutes\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe capstone exercise synthesizes all prior learning, requiring teams to design, prototype, and present a comprehensive solution. Fifty minutes is allocated to allow for brainstorming, division of tasks, and preparation of a presentation. The 20-minute debrief supports peer and instructor feedback, critical for reinforcing learning and evaluating solution feasibility.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Module | Exercise Type                                 | Duration (min) | Debrief (min) | Justification Summary                                 |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Case study analysis                           | 20             | 10            | Conceptual, group discussion, low technical barrier  |\n| 2      | Prompt design/testing                         | 30             | 10            | Iterative, requires experimentation and feedback     |\n| 3      | Guided API integration                        | 40             | 15            | Technical, step-by-step, troubleshooting involved    |\n| 4      | Fine-tuning strategy planning                 | 35             | 10            | Analytical, group planning, no live training         |\n| 5      | Compliance scenario planning                  | 20             | 10            | Critical thinking, application of best practices     |\n| 6      | Capstone: solution design & presentation      | 50             | 20            | Synthesis, teamwork, presentation, feedback          |\n\n---\n\nThese exercise durations are calibrated to balance depth of engagement with the overall course flow, ensuring participants have ample opportunity to apply concepts while maintaining momentum throughout the program.",
