Use Custom Instructions to enforce citation requirements, privacy posture, tone, and safety; configure retrieval options (chunking, metadata). Build a 10-question retrieval QA suite and log outcomes in retrieval_test_log. Introduce no-code Actions via structured outputs (JSON-like responses) for predictable handoffs.\n### Takeaways:\n- Custom GPT scaffold with Knowledge uploaded and retrieval options calibrated\n- 10-question retrieval QA suite with logged pass/fail, citations, and abstentions\n- Structured output template suitable for no-code Actions\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants configure a Custom GPT with Knowledge and enforce citation/abstention rules.\n- Participants design and run a retrieval QA suite with measurable thresholds.\n- Participants produce structured outputs for reliable downstream consumption.\n- Participants document tuning levers (chunking, file formats, Knowledge refresh cadence).\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 120 minutes, Debrief: 30 minutes\n\n## 6. Browsing, Grounding, and Citations Under Uncertainty\n### Description:\nEnable Browse to incorporate time-sensitive or external evidence within constrained domains. Practice source verification, decide when to answer versus abstain, and log link provenance and evidence quality. Integrate browsed evidence with Knowledge-backed responses without compromising auditability.\n### Takeaways:\n- Browse policy template with domain allowlists and source-quality criteria\n- Citation exemplars with verification notes and link provenance\n- Safe-failure and escalation patterns for ambiguous or out-of-distribution prompts\n### Learning Goals:\n- Participants configure Browse within scoped domains and capture traceable citations.\n- Participants validate sources and record verification steps aligned to governance.\n- Participants implement abstention and escalation when evidence is insufficient or stale.\n- Participants integrate browsed and Knowledge responses while preserving provenance.\n### Exercise Description:\nDuration: 70 minutes, Debrief: 35 minutes\n\n## 7.
